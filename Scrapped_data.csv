February 2, 2022|
The constantly evolving digital media landscape is putting organizations under a great deal of pressure to produce content that builds their brand identity and brings them closer to their customers. With content demands growing, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for them to manage the digital assets necessary to create all that content. That’s why many organizations have already discovered the benefits of digital asset management (DAM) platforms capable of creating a single source of truth for their growing content libraries.
10 ways a digital asset management platform helps your business
Although companies often try to get by with existing tools and software they already have in place, there are several benefits of a digital asset management system that make it a worthwhile technology investment.
1. Fewer lost assets
Over time, organizations can go through multiple storage options for their digital assets. In addition to cloud-based storage, they may even have content saved on physical drives that are not easily accessible. This not only makes it hard to find assets when they’re needed, but also increases the likelihood that important files will be lost in the shuffle. A DAM system stores and organizes all digital assets in a centralized location, so they can be accessed securely from a single platform. Files are far less likely to be misplaced, which eliminates the need to replace lost content.
2. Streamlined collaboration
Today’s creative teams frequently work across multiple departments within an organization or with external collaborators to produce content. Without a centralized system in place for managing digital assets, they can encounter difficulties getting the right materials uploaded and making sure they’re all working from the same version of those files. A good DAM system makes it easy for multiple contributors to quickly share assets using upload links and dedicated portals rather than passing content between several different storage locations and delivery methods that can slow down collaboration and create confusion. By setting up linear workflows, organizations can ensure that each task has everything it needs for success, from easily providing access to the correct file to identifying everyone who should be working on the task from start to finish.
3. Better brand consistency
Building and maintaining a consistent brand identity can be a major challenge for an organization, especially when employees are engaging with customers and the public across multiple media channels. All it takes is a single low-resolution graphic or an out-of-date image posted online to undermine trust in that brand. By consolidating approved brand assets within a central DAM portal, organizations can ensure that all public facing content meets the exacting standards established by its brand messaging team. Making that portal broadly available to people throughout the organization also provides the added benefit of turning everyone into a potential brand advocate, which helps to further establish brand identity in the market.
4. Enhanced access control
Managing who has access to digital assets can quickly become a hassle when files are scattered in multiple storage locations. Access privileges need to be granted, tracked, and frequently withdrawn, which can be further complicated if the assets reside in systems that contain sensitive content. It may also be necessary to grant limited access to prevent someone from downloading or editing files. Digital asset management systems allow administrators to control access privileges from a single platform, making it much easier to keep digital assets secure and allow people to access only the files they need at any given time.
5. Content insights and usage data
When multiple people are handling digital assets, it’s important to have some transparency into their activities and how content is being used. Tracking those details is often difficult when storage platforms lack the reporting tools to provide specific details on content and user behavior. A DAM system provides a single source of truth for all interactions with digital assets, allowing administrators to see who is interacting with content, determine how they are using it, and conduct audits at the content or user level to gather additional insights.
6. Saved time and money
Organizations waste weeks every year searching for photos, videos, and other digital files. Assuming that the content is still stored somewhere in the system, finding the right version of an asset can be an exercise in frustration if no single source of truth for all content is available. Time lost hunting for the right version of a file can quickly translate into lost money as project deadlines fall behind schedule. With a DAM system in place that makes it easy to locate assets through metadata information, tags, and keywords, organizations can help their teams work more efficiently and effectively, ensuring that more time is spent creating powerful content rather than searching for it.
7. Tighter security
After investing in creating digital assets, it’s important to take the right precautions that keep them safe and secure. When files are stored in on-premises drives or scattered across multiple cloud storage services, there’s a greater chance of assets being compromised due to security gaps or human error. Cloud-based digital asset management platforms store those valuable assets in highly secure data centers that are fully SOC 2 compliant and protected by state-of-the-art electronic surveillance and multi-factor access control systems. The files themselves are further protected by SSL encryption and can be distributed to collaborators over secure, private workspaces using time-sensitive share links that expire after the project is completed.
8. Expanded integrations
Creative teams rely upon multiple platforms to generate content. Whether it’s a graphic designer working with images for a Photoshop project or an account manager putting together a project proposal with PowerPoint, having quick and easy access to the right assets can help speed the process along. Digital asset management software integrates with the tools and applications organizations use every day to enhance productivity and avoid vendor lock-in. These integrations can provide access to even more storage, connect DAM assets to CMS tools and creative suites, and even link content in approved DAM portals to social media channels.
9. Improved digital rights management
Most organizations make extensive use of licensed content, usually in the form of stock photos, videos, and icons. It’s easy to make the mistake of thinking that once purchased, those assets can be stored in a folder and used anywhere. Unfortunately, that’s often not the case. Restrictions on the use of copyrighted digital assets can be quite specific, and failing to track how that content is used can place a business in legal jeopardy. Luckily, DAM software makes it easy to monitor the licensing status of all assets in the content library through digital rights management (DRM) tools. This ensures that licensed material will not be deployed improperly and makes it possible to track down how copyrighted, proprietary assets are used and shared across the organization.
10. Expanded sharing options for unique audiences
Although generic cloud storage platforms can share links to content relatively securely, this is hardly the ideal solution for every situation. In some instances, digital assets may need to be shared with a broad audience or made available to specific people for only a short period of time. A DAM platform provides multiple ways of sharing content securely, ranging from something as simple as an expiring link to as robust as a dedicated public facing portal that allows anyone to browse content through their web browser. Entire creative projects can even be managed through customizable portals, with a combination of public and private portals sharing a portion of the larger DAM library with various users, all of whom may have different levels of access.

6,https://www.canto.com/blog/16-tips-for-selecting-dam-system/,"16 questions to ask when selecting a digital asset management system
June 23, 2021|
Digital asset management (DAM) software like Canto helps rein in file chaos, centralizing images, video and other assets in an easy-to-use media library. Teams that switch to a professional DAM solution get more out of their digital assets and win back the weeks – even months – lost each year searching for files.
But choosing a DAM provider can be overwhelming. What features matter most? What do you need to know to compare options?
To make the process easier, we’ve put together a checklist of questions to ask, so you can shop confidently and pick the DAM solution that’s right for your team.
1. Is it searchable?
The assets in your media library won’t do you much good if you can’t find them. A good search function is a must.
In addition to standard keyword searches, a sophisticated DAM system will filter by author, date, project, file type and more. Features like smart tags and image recognition make assets searchable, even if you haven’t added keywords manually.
2. Will it scale?
Before you commit to a DAM system, find out how it will scale with you as your asset collection grows. Can you add more storage at the push of a button? What about adding more users as your team expands?
The bigger your company gets, the more important it becomes to have a centralized media library that’s easy to access. So look to the future, and pick a DAM system that will serve you well for years to come.
3. Is it customizable?
Every organization is a unique ecosystem of people, processes and procedures. Your DAM system should fit your needs, whatever they are. Are there customizable fields for categorizing assets? Can you update external portals with your own logo, colors and imagery to fit your brand?
Consider how easy customizations are to implement. Is it a simple setting adjustment, or does it require tons of custom code?
4. How steep is the learning curve?
One of the great things about a DAM library is that you can open it to anyone and everyone who needs to access your assets – but only if they can learn how to use it.
With an intuitive interface, end users can hit the ground running. More complex systems may require more training, both for the administrators who manage your assets and for the people who need to retrieve them.
5. How do you input metadata?
A good DAM system doesn’t just store assets, it puts them in context.
Metadata is additional information you provide for each asset. It can include keywords, dates, copyright, product line, approval status and any other information useful to your organization. Make sure your DAM solution provides automated metadata management to organize files accurately and save you from large-scale data entry projects.
6. Does it integrate with other tools you use?
Integrations speed up your workflow, saving you the trouble of constantly exporting assets only to upload them somewhere else.
Look for out-of-the-box integrations with design tools like Adobe for easy asset creation and editing. Use social media integrations to share images straight from your library. Publish assets on your website faster with CMS integrations.
Need something more niche? Your DAM should offer a robust API, so your developers can connect it with any application you like.
7. Is it video compatible?
If video is part of your content strategy, make sure your DAM system can handle video content. Can you preview video files without exporting them? Can you trim video to download just the clips you need? Is there a PremierePro integration?
Not all DAM systems are video compatible, so if you work with lots of video assets, make sure to try before you buy.
8. Is it cloud-based?
On-site DAM solutions require a lot of IT resources to set up and maintain servers and ensure adequate security. Accessing assets off-site can be a pain, and scaling up as your company grows requires purchasing new hardware.
Fortunately, there’s a more manageable alternative. Software as a service (SaaS) DAM providers host assets securely on the cloud. With no hardware to maintain, there’s no barrier to entry for companies with small IT teams. Plus, you only pay for the resources you use, and it’s easy to add users or upgrade storage capacity with the push of a button.
9. Can you access your assets on mobile devices?
Everybody is on the go these days, and sometimes key assets need to be available in the field.
You’ll want a DAM interface that is accessible quickly and safely from all mobile devices. This includes smartphones, tablets and laptops. That way, team members working from home or on the go can access whatever they need from anywhere.
If you plan on using your DAM’s mobile app, make sure it offers all the features you need. Some apps only offer a pared down version with limited functionality.
10. How will the new DAM system fit into your team structure?
Dropping a DAM system into an existing ecosystem of users and workflows may require some adjustments to how your team operates. Decide who needs to access what assets, who should approve assets for use and who will have ownership of your new and improved media library.
11. Can you assign different permissions to different users?
For a DAM library to serve a whole organization, administrators need to be able to control who can access what.
Admins need access to everything, and the ability to approve assets for use. Other users may only need access to certain libraries, certain assets or low-res versions of images.
Flexible permissions help everyone get exactly what they need.
12. How will it speed up your workflows?
Map out your processes and see where better digital asset management could eliminate unnecessary steps. This will help you decide what features to prioritize.
Is your marketing team constantly fielding requests for assets? Look for a DAM system that will allow other teams to self-serve straight from a library of pre-approved media. Need to get images from photographers in the field onto social media? Look for flexible upload options so anyone can add images directly to your library – wherever they are.
13. Does it have reporting and analytics?
Centralizing all your assets in one place isn’t just about efficiency. It also gives you a better overview of your asset library.
Robust reporting and analytics offer insights into how your assets are being used. If you’re getting a lot of mileage out of certain assets, you might want to create more like them. You can see if valuable assets are being underutilized or spot other patterns to refine your content strategy. DAM systems also help protect assets from misuse by keeping track of who’s downloading what.
14. Is it secure?
Keep your digital assets safe by ensuring your DAM provider uses proper encryption and security protocols. Where will your assets be stored? Is the data center secure? A reputable DAM provider shouldn’t hesitate to discuss security.
15. What’s the vendor’s reputation?
Choose a trusted vendor with an established track record of providing DAM services to major brands. DAM is a complex field, and it takes time to build up the expertise to serve clients well.
Do your research and read independent reviews. Pay particular attention to reviews about whatever you value most – be it security, customer service or ease of use.
16. How good is the customer support?
Look for a DAM vendor who will support your team with true customer care and a dedicated support staff. Digital asset management is an ongoing process, not just a one-time installation.
When you get in touch with potential vendors, tell them what you’re looking for and how you want it implemented. Get a feel for how quickly they respond and how they interact with you. Look for clues to guide you to a vendor with great customer service.

The DAM Summit 2017 was the perfect place to learn about DAM and other related topics. The theme this year was ‘Change: The Heart of Growth’ and the sessions reflected this. There were engaging workshops and presentations as well as personal testimonies from longtime Canto customers, partners as well as DAM professionals from around the world.
This is the first time I participated at the DAM Summit. I got a lot of input from different sides with new ideas.
The result was an impressive array of insights given to customers and partners alike. Stefan Grünwald, Global Incident Manager at Schlüter-Systems told us, “AI was very interesting and could be a tool we could use in the future for our requirements for auto-tagging assets in Cumulus.”
Workshops with Cansu Oral and John Horodyski were amazing. Also the presentation of Theresa Regli.
The DAM Summit brought together top DAM professionals and industry influencers from Seattle to Stockholm and Shanghai. Organizations like EyeEm, KlarisIP, Optimity Advisors, IUBH University of Applied Sciences, the Giessen 46ers, movingimage, Bistum Würzburg and many more shared their knowledge at the 2017 DAM Summit.
Adam Cowie, from our partner DataBasics, attended Thomas Schleu’s workshop ‘How to Get the Most out of Cumulus’ and learned “how to promote the Cumulus user the best user experience possible”. This sentiment about the workshops was prevalent for 2017 DAM Summit attendees.
A DAM excellent networking opportunity
Embracing the change is a lot about adaptation and continuous learning.
The DAM Summit is an excellent place for Canto customers to talk with other Canto customers and exchange ideas and well as insights into the industry and how it’s changing. Customers have the unique opportunity to discuss information about the product with the folks who design Canto’s products. The networking environment was designed for optimal DAM information exchange.
The DAM Summit is an efficient way to gather the latest Cumulus information and get an overview of Canto’s roadmap.
Our Platinum Sponsor, movingimage, has “a long history with Canto, over five years,” says Sebastian Picklum, Product Vision Owner and speaker at this year’s DAM Summit. This continued partnership has been successful for the company as well as the sponsorship with Canto for the DAM Summit. There were plenty of opportunities for all the sponsors to network and elaborate how their integrations and business partnerships enable DAM professionals to enhance their particular needs.
Great opportunity to meet other customers and network
We have plenty of longtime partners at the DAM Summit with some totaling 20 years of cooperation, like Jesper Arentoft from Attention Solutions, who said the 2017 DAM Summit was “an efficient way to gather the latest Cumulus information and get an overview of Canto’s roadmap.” Partners and customers alike benefit from this networking-conducive environment.
DAM good organization and atmosphere
Internationally recognized DAM experts at a nice location with a relaxed atmosphere
The venues of the 2017 DAM Summit were well-received by attendees, as one pointed out, “it was a great atmosphere. Not only at Kalkscheune but above all also at Stone Brewing.” The DAM Summit was enjoyable and relaxed and optimal for information exchange. According to attendees, the event was “well-organized” and “easy-to-navigate”.
And now, a DAM (Summit) summary
DAM Summit was a great and as far as I could take part very insightful event, that I will definitely recommend to colleagues.
Theresa Regli summed up our theme ‘Change: The Heart of Growth’ and how it aligned with the content of the DAM Summit. She told us, “I get asked a lot by people who are DAM managers or who work with metadata ‘is my job going to be replaced by artificial intelligence’ and I think the answer is your job is going to change if you are smart enough to adapt. You have to learn about how the software works; you have to work with it; you have to complement it. Embracing the change is a lot about adaptation and continuous learning.”
We want to drive future trends in the industry and importantly we want to provide value to our customers.
The 2017 DAM Summit was filled with insights for our customers, partners and other DAM enthusiasts so they can learn to adapt to these changes. But it’s also a place for Canto to learn, as Canto’s CEO Jack McGannon elaborated: “As we want to be a knowledge expert, we want to drive future trends in the industry and importantly we want to provide value to our customers. It’s really important that we get the feedback from our customers so we can deliver against their business needs and their challenges.”
In conclusion, it was a really great event in which I would probably attend the next few years. I would like to thank the whole Canto team and their sponsors for the great event. Especially Ines Köhler for the great organization.
We enjoyed hosting and hope to see everyone back next year. Stay tuned for more information on the next DAM Summit.

September 23, 2019|
Natasha Adams, CMO of Kodakit, joined us for a conversation about her best practices for digital asset management (DAM), based on her many years of experience leading marketing organizations.
For Natasha, DAM forms the foundation of successful marketing.
“I think a lot of people disregard the operational part of marketing, which is really the backbone. Without that foundation, no marketer can be successful. Asset management has been in my DNA for the last 10 years and I truly believe it will continue to be as I grow in these functions in marketing,” said Natasha.
We couldn’t have said it better ourselves! With that in mind, let’s dive into Natasha’s tips for successful DAM.
Best practices for digital asset management
1. Get your team’s buy-in first
It starts with the team. You can buy great off-the-shelf solutions, but without your team’s buy-in, those solutions won’t gain traction. The team has to be bought into what the systems can offer, and bought into plugging data into that tool daily and making sure they stay on top of their responsibilities when it comes to that tool, such as uploading assets with the correct metadata and in the correct folders.
2. Stay organized even as the team grows
As the company grows, it needs to grow with the same foundation and organizational structure. Make sure everyone is on the same page and knows what to do at every step of the process. Team members should be able to answer questions like:
- How are we naming files and tagging images?
- How are we letting people know there’s new content online?
- How are we getting our stakeholders involved and what’s the review or approval process?
3. Track your assets over their lifetime and learn from your metrics
Managing an asset doesn’t just end with uploading it into a DAM. With today’s tools, you can actually measure things like the uptake of these assets and how they are being used. Use these metrics to be honest with yourself and take responsibility for your assets. For example, if you’re a marketer and you’ve created sales sheets for the sales team, but no one is using them – use that information to move forward and work more effectively.
How Kodakit implemented DAM best practices with Canto
Kodakit chose Canto because it checked all of their boxes and enables the team to implement DAM best practices with ease.
- Full team buy-in: “Canto has all the components of how marketers want to work today. It’s extremely user-friendly and modern. Getting the full team buy-in for Canto was the biggest win,” said Natasha.
- Scalability: “We’re growing between 10-15x a year. We need something that works with our speed. Canto being really fast and turnkey was important.”
- Cloud-based and flexible: “Canto being cloud-based gives us tremendous flexibility and global reach. People have real-time access to the tool.”
- Room to grow: “Canto meets greater than 90% of our needs and we don’t even use the tools to the max.”
- Friendly price: “For a startup, it’s affordable.”
Using Canto, Kodakit has a centralized digital asset library that empowers their multinational marketing and sales teams to access any content, including documents, that they need – whether that’s images or slide decks or contracts. They also use Canto portals to share assets more quickly with outside partners and vendors across multiple countries."

October 11, 2019|
You’ve done your research, sat through countless demos, and at long last you have bought a new DAM solution! You can’t wait to get started, but there’s just one final step: migrating your existing content into your new solution.
It may seem like a chore, but we promise it’s actually a piece of cake with Canto! Our implementation team is with you every step of the way with guidance and technical help. But we’ll let our customers who have been through the process speak for themselves.
Here are their top tips:
1. Set up your folder structure first
This is a tip echoed by multiple customers. Getting your folder structure figured out up front helps your team get the most out of your DAM, because team members will be better able to find assets more quickly.
Derek Wolfford, marketing manager of integrated media at Pearl, says, “Organization is key. Make sure the folder architecture is what you want in Canto before you start dragging stuff over.”
In practice, this means thinking through what makes the most sense for your team. At Visit Seattle, creative director David Newman implemented the folder structure in a way that made sense for the organization: each department has its own folder which contains content most relevant to them.
We’ve seen customers organize folders by department, photoshoot date and photographer, or even assign individual approvers folders so that they know where all of their content to review lives.
2. Create 25-30 keywords as a starting point
Keywords help you categorize assets on a more detailed level, helping team members find content via search and filter. They can only be set by administrators, so setting up a number of keywords in the beginning can help your team organize content as they upload, and find it later.
“From day one, classify the 25-30 keywords that are appropriate for the organization. You can easily fill in the gaps with tags,” says George Comeau, marketing and brand activation manager at Downtown Boston Business Improvement District.
“If you think a photo should be labeled with a keyword but that keyword doesn’t exist, write it on a scratch pad. If you find yourself writing down the same word over and over again, then it should be a keyword. Otherwise, you can just add that label as a tag and either way it will show up in search.”
3. Use this opportunity to sort out what’s useful and what can be left behind
Chances are, not all of your assets will be valuable moving forward. This is a great opportunity to assess what your team can use and what you should migrate, and leave behind any assets that are no longer useful and just taking up storage space.
George from Downtown Boston Business Improvement District did just this when his team migrated to Canto, and also takes care to keep only useful assets in Canto going forward to avoid recreating clutter."

January 13, 2020|
Searching for the right digital asset management solution? Here are three questions to make sure you’re choosing the best solution for your team.
1. Does this solution meet my team’s needs and goals?
As you begin searching for a DAM solution, make a list of the functionality your team needs to achieve its goals. Don’t get distracted by bells and whistles – i.e. features that look fun and shiny but that your team doesn’t actually need – and home in on the capabilities that will make a real difference in your workflows.
2. How will this solution support my team’s growth?
Most of us don’t want to buy and implement new systems and software every few years, so make sure you buy a solution that gives your team and library room to grow.
Keep these questions in mind as you evaluate: How easy and affordable is it to add more storage and users? How quickly are you able to get new users up and running? Does the platform support other teams or companies of similar size and larger?
3. Does the solution provide customer support?
…Or are you on your own once you buy it? Consider the level of customer support you would like. Are you okay with more impersonalized tech support or do you prefer having a dedicated customer support representative who understands your team’s needs and supports you throughout the entire process?"

October 2, 2019|
For many teams, there’s a tipping point when they outgrow cloud storage and need a true digital asset management (DAM) solution that centralizes their library and makes it easy to find and share assets. Here are three reasons that brands move on from cloud storage to Canto.
1. A visual, user-friendly experience
DAM is designed to be a visual platform. Users can upload any file type and preview content so that they can see what’s in their digital library at a glance. An intuitive design means that creative professionals can work within a single system that makes sense to them, whether or not they have technical experience. Canto’s focus on visual assets means that it’s designed to make storing and sharing images as easy as possible.
Cloud storage links may work well for sharing documents, but the user experience isn’t optimized for visual assets. Teams with hundreds or thousands of images benefit from using a DAM that is designed to store, organize and share visual assets, so you can see exactly what you’re working with.
“Our PR and social media agencies really love Canto! We were using Dropbox with them before, and Canto is more user-friendly,” Roqueta says. “It’s easy for them to resize or change image formats in case they need something for a certain media outlet: they can just identify the size and format they need and download it directly from Canto,” said Alessandra Roqueta, marketing manager of Boral North America’s Stone Division.
2. Easy search and filter
DAM systems provide many features that help users easily find what they’re looking for. Users can search, pulling up any assets with matching keywords, tags, descriptions or file names. Canto also automatically applies “smart tags” to uploaded content and users can apply facial recognition as well to make the search process even easier.
Bumkins was using a patchy combination of servers, Dropbox, and tribal knowledge to locate and share assets. Without a DAM, it was difficult for team members to find exactly what they needed.
“The problem with cloud storage and servers is that things are hard to find and they’re not very visual. Most of the time, the team would get frustrated with searching and just come ask me because I knew where everything was,” said Leyna Segal, photo editor at Bumkins.
With Canto, the Bumkins team adds keywords and tags to their assets to make it easier for users to find what they need. In addition, Canto’s layered search and filter functionality helps users find assets quickly, creating a culture of self-service.
3. Metadata and digital rights management
Most organizations use content created by a variety of sources, including third party photographers; as a result, their content will have different rights and expiration dates for usage. It’s important for companies to manage these digital rights because mistakenly using content without permission can result in expensive legal troubles.
Canto allows users to add expiration dates to content and automatically archives expired assets, taking the risk and extra work out of the equation. With cloud storage, users can’t add custom metadata fields such as usage rights. While it’s possible to work around this hurdle by sorting expired content into different folders, it’s a tedious manual task and it’s much too easy to make a mistake with large repercussions for the company.
Seattle Aquarium chose Canto because the marketing team needed a DAM to manage digital rights for their content. On their previous system consisting of a server and cloud storage, the team had no way of knowing which content they had the rights to use. Once they started using Canto, they were able to add content expiration dates and usage rights to the metadata.

December 13, 2019|
As consumer tastes evolve, our job as marketers is to stay a step ahead. For 2020, we’re seeing big potential in visual social media marketing: using images and video to connect with consumers via social media channels.
Don’t take our word for it; see what the data says! Consumer content preferences for social images and video are growing, and will continue to grow among younger generations, according to the 2017 Hubspot Content Trends Survey. The tea leaves spell it out clearly: the future of marketing is in social media, and future content has to be visual.
Here are three ways to keep your social media game on point in 2020.
1. Make it personal
Consumers don’t follow brands’ social media accounts for a regurgitation of the same marketing materials they see in emails and ads. Users go on social media for entertainment and a more authentic connection with their favorite brands; they don’t want to feel sold to.
Social media gives businesses a unique opportunity to share a more personal side of the brand, such as ‘behind-the-scenes’ content and sneak peeks. Create original imagery and video to share on social, and prioritize authentic and engaging content over overly polished imagery or stock photos – don’t be afraid to go live or share fun iPhone candids from the office.
Who’s doing it right: We love how Everlane does ‘Transparency Tuesday’s’ on their Instagram stories: their social media manager goes around their San Francisco HQ and asks real team members to answer questions about the brand submitted by followers. It doesn’t get much more personal than that!
2. Share user-generated content
Why not use social media for what it’s best at – connecting and cultivating community? Cultivate your own community of brand advocates and fans by sharing user-generated content, with the users’ consent, of course. User-generated content also gets more engagement, and consumers tend to trust other consumers more than brands.
Don’t have a ton of user-generated content yet? Try encouraging customers to create and share content via giveaways and challenges, or working with influencers to broaden your reach and create lifestyle imagery.
We know that putting this tip into practice is easier said than done, especially for B2B companies (believe us, we know the struggle), but it just requires a little creativity! We’ve found success with user-generated content through our awesome employees, who love to post photos and videos from our team events, and our incredible customers who love to show off their Canto socks and other swag.
Who’s doing it right: Apple created the hashtag #ShotoniPhone on Instagram to encourage customers to show off their best iPhone shots. Thanks to this campaign, consumers associate iPhones with great camera quality!
3. Harness the growing power of video
On social media, posts containing videos generate 12 times more shares than text and images combined, and 75.6 percent of marketers say video has had a direct impact on their business (source). We think we’ve said enough; time to get recording!
Create effective videos for social by following these simple best practices: Make it short (30 seconds or less is best), and give it text or subtitles, because many users scrolling on mobile may not have sound on.
Who’s doing it right: Ellevest does a weekly video on their LinkedIn page, where their CEO answers common questions that women have about investing. It’s short, to-the-point, and informative – plus, it puts a friendly and knowledgeable face behind the brand to build consumer trust."

October 9, 2019|
Working together effectively as a team is, obviously, great for the business, but it also helps give team members a sense of purpose, belonging and satisfaction at work, increasing employee retention. Here are three ways you can encourage collaboration within your team.
Nurture an open work environment
True collaboration needs to happen in an environment where team members feel comfortable communicating openly. In meetings, give team members space to ask questions and provide feedback. Demonstrate honest and productive communication as a leader by clearly setting expectations, being transparent, and hearing out team members when they have input or disagree with your decisions.
Build team relationships
Working together is a lot easier when – surprise, surprise – you like the people you’re working with. Strengthening interpersonal relationships within your team goes a long way towards encouraging collaboration.
Building relationships takes time and doesn’t just happen over the occasional team-bonding exercise. As a manager, work in time each week to connect with individual members of your team on a one-to-one basis and set up time for your team members to connect with each other.
Encourage personal connection beyond the daily tasks of your team and show that you care about your team members’ lives outside the office, too. Even simple social interactions such as coffee runs and team lunches help create a happy team over time! In the Canto office, we often initiate social activities inside and outside the office, including coffee, juice and boba runs, yoga classes and happy hours, in addition to our team quarterly celebrations.
Use technology to connect your team
Whether your team is distributed or not, it’s easy to get stuck working in silos rather than cohesively as a unit. Using cloud-based technologies that anyone can access from anywhere with an internet connection helps your team work together, no matter where they are. If your team is distributed, turning on the video during conference calls can help remote team members get ‘face time.’
For teams that work in the same physical space, it’s still useful to have centralized platforms that team members can access for information and project management. Have one source of truth for project timelines and tasks and one for all of your brand assets and files so your team can stay on the same page and prevent crossed wires.
For example, Inspirato uses Canto to store all of their visual assets. Instead of spending time figuring out what assets they have or where certain assets are, the team now focuses on how they can use their assets creatively to achieve their goals.
“Canto helped us create a culture of self-service and meaningful collaboration,” said Joe Rahim, digital asset manager at Inspirato. “It democratized all of our content: everybody can see it quickly, understand what we have, and download it in a variety of different sizes and formats according to what they need.”

November 14, 2019|
Keeping your team happy and motivated is a win-win scenario: they’re engaged and excited to come to work, and your company benefits from higher productivity and employee retention.
But employee satisfaction isn’t just about team happy hours and axe-throwing excursions (although both are fun activities that we’ve enjoyed at the SF office). It’s about cultivating a healthy workplace environment that rewards employees for contributing their best. Here are three ways to do just that!
1. Show appreciation and celebrate success
It’s important to cultivate a culture of appreciation to make your team feel that the work they do matters. Positive reinforcement is the best way to motivate employees, according to a study published in the Harvard Business Review. Employees are more inclined to keep working hard if they get positive feedback in response to their achievements.
At Canto, we have a TV that plays a fun song or video when our team members hit their goals. We also have a Slack channel called #cheersforpeers, where we post notes of appreciation for our colleagues. These are fun ways that we can celebrate each other’s successes every day.
2. Invest in employee wellbeing
Employers are increasingly realizing the benefits of investing in their employees’ health and wellbeing both in and outside of the office. According to the Harvard Business Review, too much stress results in lower performance, and according to the McKinsey Quarterly, lack of job control—the amount of discretion employees have to determine what they do and how they do it – creates a stressful environment that translates into health problems.
Another issue that can contribute to stress is lack of work life balance. A recent study commissioned by Canto revealed that 46% of marketers surveyed have worked late, 28% cut into their lunch break and 25% don’t have time to take a coffee break because they have lost too much time hunting for files needed to do their work.
To combat this, promote a work environment where employees feel ownership over their work and have the support they need to take care of their health. Many employers also invest in employee health programs as part of their benefit package, such as fitness stipends and counseling, and more companies are offering remote or flexible work opportunities to help employees balance their personal lives and careers.
3. Provide opportunities to learn and grow
The best employees are driven to grow professionally. A workplace that helps employees develop their careers attracts motivated individuals and encourages employee retention, while preventing the feeling of stagnation that leads to decreased motivation.
Make sure employees feel empowered about their career progression and skills development at your company by having managers discuss long-term career goals and providing opportunities for training and development, such as sending employees to workshops and conferences.

15,https://www.canto.com/blog/3-ways-to-speed-up-social-media-workflows-with-dam/,"3 ways to speed up social media workflows with DAM
December 3, 2019|
For social media marketers, speed is essential to success. Social media constantly keeps us on our toes, challenging us to be timely, relevant and pithy – all at breakneck speed. We also somehow find a way to keep up with trends, memes and the latest algorithm updates.
To create and share the best content, it’s key to have quick access to the assets you need. Here are four tips to power up your social media workflows.
1. Stay flexible with a cloud-based content library
Social media emergencies can strike at any time, even when your team is OOO. Having a cloud-based digital asset library means that your social media team can access the content they need from anywhere.
When such an emergency struck at Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF), here’s how they dealt with it:
“On Saturday of Labor Day weekend, I was sitting in my beach chair when I found out that Valerie Harper Rhoda had passed away. She had visited OMRF in 1998,” says Jenny Lee, creative director at OMRF.
“From my beach chair, I was able to locate her photo and the press release from her visit in our Canto archive. I sent it off to my writing partner, who then wrote up a tribute. We got it posted within an hour of getting the news – on a Saturday with nobody in the office. That’s why cloud-based is so great for us.”
2. Empower your social media team to self-serve
Your social media team should be able to pull the image or video they need and share it within a matter of minutes. Cut out the time-consuming steps of submitting image requests or digging through unorganized archives to help your team boost those impressions!
To make it easy on your team, have a one-stop shop for social media content. We’ve seen customers save hours a day by consolidating their content library in Canto, which has an intuitive folder structure and search and filter functions that make it easy for team members to find exactly the visual they need.
3. Avoid content purgatory by tracking digital rights
The last thing a social media marketer wants to discover after finally finding the perfect piece of content to share is that they don’t have the digital rights to use it!
If your organization doesn’t track digital rights, it can be tedious or even impossible to find out if your team has permission to use certain photos or graphics. We’ve worked with organizations that have thousands of photos they can’t use because of this issue. If we had to think of ways to torture marketers, this would be high up on that list.
We love the clever way that Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) manages their photo permissions. The communications team has thousands of photos of the tenants they help, including families and children, which require photo release forms to use.
“One of the things we really needed was a way to connect photo release forms with the photos themselves,” says Susanna Linse, SHA’s communications manager. “With Canto we are able to relate files and easily access the associated documents through the asset’s information page.”"
16,https://www.canto.com/blog/3gp-video-file/,"What is a 3GP video file and how do I open it?
March 10, 2020|
The 3GP video file gives users the ability to instantly transfer video files to other members, boosting efficiency. It’s a solution for anyone seeking to communicate and share video files quickly. It is also extensively used in multimedia text messages, something growing in prevalence as smartphones continue to improve and popularize. This guide will make sure you understand what a 3GP does, how to open it and some of the pros and cons.
What is a 3GP video file?
3GP is the Third Generation Partnership Project video file extension, saved in a video and audio format. It’s a video file containing streams capable of playing on mobile devices and web browsers. It was designed to function at a high level on 3G devices. It does this by functioning as a smaller bandwidth and data usage option. Most importantly, it supports the use of multimedia sharing in text messages.
How do I open a 3GP?
A wide array of programs and devices can open a 3GP. For example, mobile devices such as smartphones can open it without downloading any specific third-party apps. Popular programs such as Quicktime are capable of opening the 3GP as well. Furthermore, there are plenty of different programs users can download if they need alternate ways to open 3GP video files. Below are some recommended tools to consider based on your operating system.
If you’re using Windows and want an alternative method to open your 3GP files, consider VLC Media Player by VideoLAN. It’s a free-to-use tool that gives Windows users a way to open video files without the need for extensive codecs. Note that this player also works for the Mac if one is unsatisfied with the different Mac-based options. Which brings us to our next tool, designed to be effective for Mac users, Quicktime. As mentioned earlier, this program is the flagship Mac tool to play 3GP and other video formats. It’s fairly simple to get the hang of as well. Now that you have a few different methods to open your 3GP, here are some pros and cons of using them.
Some advantages of using this file type
The biggest advantage of the 3GP is its size. It’s a small video file designed to save disk space. This is why it’s great for transferring videos over mobile devices – the small size uses tiny amounts of data. Without 3GP, mobile users with limited data plans are restricted from communicating freely using multimedia in text messages. Since we continually increase the amount of communication that takes place via smartphones, this has grown in importance.
Another advantage of 3GP is it creates connected environments for businesses. Text messages with important video files and multimedia are sent between team members, enhancing communication. There are times when members aren’t at their computer or don’t have access to chat software tools. However, they’ll still need to message important video files to one another. This makes 3GP highly important in company communication.
Some disadvantages to be aware of
The 3GP is a small-sized file, which can be advantage but has serious downsides. For example, it brings with it the problem of quality issues. Because of it’s small size, its resolution suffers. This is because the type of compression it uses doesn’t retain its full quality. Ultimately, this makes it less than ideal for playing high resolution videos. Note that this is a necessary downside, at least for now. Certainly the type of file used to play videos on a smartphone is going to require it be a smaller size.
It also can’t be opened by as many programs compared to other video file types. Users have to download converter software to change the 3GP to a more manageable video file extension. This adds an unfortunate layer of work to an otherwise useful file type. It also stands to reason that the smaller file size might be a double-edged sword, often requiring drive space to be used on extra software systems.
Future outlook
3GP remains valuable because it cemented itself as the standard video file type for sending multimedia in text messages. Mobile communication continues to expand, keeping 3GP at the forefront of usage for years to come. Its compression doesn’t bother the videos sent in text messages enough to be a nuisance so expect it to stick around.
The lack of quality resolution videos is irrelevant for the types of video files sent via text message, securing 3GP as a standard for messaging. Confidently assume 3GP will service the multimedia needs of mobile devices for quite some time.
3GP video files stream quickly without using much bandwidth or data – securing their spot as the standard way to send messages over mobile devices. Stay current on the developments concerning 3GP to ensure it’s the best option to use for sharing small video files."

January 15, 2020|
Companies worldwide have relied on Cumulus for more than 25 years to organize their digital assets. With its flexible configuration and powerful asset engine, Cumulus is a standard for on-premise digital asset management. Yet many organizations are switching to Canto’s cloud solution. Why is that – and when is it worth it?
1 Canto saves costs
The most important point for our customers that speaks for Canto is cost. With an on-premise licensing model like Cumulus, the initial cost of purchasing a license is relatively high, and the payback period is longer. Due to the complexity of the projects, consultants are often required to make adjustments to the system.
In contrast, Canto’s costs are more stable and predictable. Instead of software, Canto gives our customers a service they no longer have to manage. And contrary to on-premise, no hardware upgrades or other investments are required. The subscription already covers all costs. More memory, user accounts or integrations can be booked promptly.
The biggest advantage for customers: Canto is a ‘true cloud solution’ and scales to meet your performance needs at no extra cost. Running such a solution yourself would not be profitable for the vast majority of companies. With Canto, on the other hand, this service is included.
2 Canto reduces complexity
The number of possible work processes that can be mapped with Cumulus On-Premise DAM is virtually impossible. However, Cumulus’ unique feature set also requires a level of complexity that requires project planning and duration. On-premise projects can hardly be set up ad hoc. At the same time, a scenario in which all possible Cumulus functions are used is simply not imaginable.
Many customers are trying to simplify their own work processes and are considering how to do this with the tools they use. Canto offers an excellent balance – a modern user experience and a superior feature set.
3 Canto does not require lengthy on-boarding
Canto is intuitive to use and offers users the ability to quickly find what they are looking for. The ability to fully customize the interface to your branding makes it even easier for users to feel at ease. Canto’s great user experience eliminates the need for lengthy training and education in many cases.
This allows companies to use Canto very quickly. Where Cumulus often requires an IT project of its own, Canto is already in use. This makes Canto the ideal choice for anyone who needs a DAM quickly and can’t or won’t wait until their IT has enough resources to set up a complex in-house DAM.
4 You don’t need IT help for Canto
Cumulus’ extensive configuration capabilities require in-house expertise. Typically, companies have one or more people in the organization whose primary role is to support Cumulus. With years of experience in digital asset management, Cumulus can handle complex workflows and provide a powerful, long-term system.
However, staff changes often pose major problems for companies. The person in charge of DAM often has years of experience that cannot be replaced in the short term. In addition, proven experts in digital asset management incur high personnel costs and are often difficult to find. In many cases, a well-maintained DAM has to be closed because there is no one who can continue to operate it. Canto is a very good solution in such cases because it makes it much easier to maintain and hand over the system.
Is Canto worth it for me?
Canto can be rewarding for anyone who
- wants to save costs,
- wants to reduce the complexity of their workflows and tools
- wants to start directly without long on-boarding
- does not have his/her own IT or does not have the necessary resources.
Our DAM experts will show you the advantages and potential savings in your specific case. Simply make an appointment with us and we’ll work with you to see what Canto can do for you."

What all of our customers have in common is that at some point, they needed to invest in a digital asset management (DAM) solution to help their marketing and creative teams stay in sync and scale their creativity. While we, naturally, consider ourselves experts on DAM, it’s really our customers who have become experts at using a DAM solution to get their jobs done.
So, we asked a few of our customers: What advice would you give to another team like yours that is looking to invest in DAM?
Here’s what they said.
You really don’t realize how many assets you have until you put them all in one place. We did a lot of calls and really dug into it before we started uploading. We didn’t want just a dumping ground for files. Therefore, we took a measured and detailed approach in rolling Canto out. It could have been overwhelming otherwise, when you look at the number of assets that you have. So my advice would be to take your time, map out your use cases, and realize the return will far outweigh the costs.

Whether you’re excited for Mindy Kaling’s keynote speech or pre-conference yoga, Content Marketing World 2019 is sure to be a fun and educational event. There’s just one problem: with over 120 sessions hosted by world-class marketers, which ones should you attend?
Luckily for you, we’ve sorted through the entire conference schedule to bring you five sessions you won’t want to miss.
Content Marketing World 2019 will be held in Cleveland, Ohio, September 3-6.
Vishal Khanna (VP of Marketing & Communications, HealthPrize Technologies)
Date: Thursday, September 5
Time: 11:20am – 12:05pm
There is no existing solution for your brand: You’re building it. And it should be your goal to become the world’s leading expert in marketing your company. Attend this nuts-and-bolts session to find out how to build a scalable content marketing engine unique to your brand that is targeted toward conversion.
Vishal Khanna is the VP of Marketing and Communications at HealthPrize Technologies and 2015 Content Marketer of the Year, with over 20 years of experience leading content-first marketing initiatives that amplify brand, drive engagement and consistently exceed business goals.
Why you should go: Content marketing strategy isn’t one-size-fits-all. In this session, you’ll learn how to measure the effectiveness of your content marketing and iterate to develop a strategy that works best for your brand.
Lauren Quaintance (Head of Content, Storyation)
Date: Thursday, September 5
Time: 12:20pm – 1:05pm
Content marketing has become the new black, so it’s no surprise that brands and agencies run the risk that they’re simply adding to an abyss of largely redundant “stuff” customers don’t value.
We all know that segmentation, optimization and amplification are important but, as marketers, do we sometimes focus too much on reaching an audience and too little on the quality of what we’re saying?
In this session Lauren Quaintance, one of Australia’s leading content marketers, will talk about how brands can create content that gets attention in an era of saturation and deliver ROI for their organizations.
Lauren Quaintance is the co-founder and Head of Content at Storyation, and has been named one of the top 15 women in content marketing globally by the editor of the US-based Content Marketing Institute’s Chief Content Officer magazine and won the B&T Women in Media award in 2018.
Why you should go: Gone are the days when producing as much content as possible was the key to content marketing success. Now, the challenge is standing out in a saturated sea of content. This session will teach you actionable strategies to create “radically different content.”
Christopher White (Content Strategist, CapitalOne)
Date: Thursday, September 5
Time: 10:15am – 11:00am
Imagine if you proposed to everyone the first time you meet them. How many would say yes? Considering that they just met you, not many. In all the tactics and metrics, it’s easy to forget that we are still marketing to real people. And considering that the average American is exposed to 4,000-10,000 ads each day – being human is essential to cutting through the noise.
Why you should go: Working in marketing day in and day out can distance us from the real people we want to reach. This session will show you how to take a more human approach to marketing.
Kristina Halvorson (CEO, Brain Traffic)
Date: Thursday, September 5
Time: 1:45pm – 2:30pm

Kristina Halvorson is the founder and CEO of Brain Traffic, a content marketing agency that produces the popular Confab content strategy conference series. She is also coauthor of Content Strategy for the Web.

June 11, 2021|
Companies come to us every day with different goals and challenges, but they all have one thing in common: They’re motivated to step up their game, and they know that managing their digital assets will help them do that.
How, exactly? Let’s look at the most common issues one at a time. Here are the top five reasons teams decide to take control of their media libraries and get serious about digital asset management.
1. Assets are too hard to find
Many teams store their assets in multiple places, including servers, hard drives, cloud storage and email attachments. This makes it hard to find what you’re looking for, especially on large teams with growing media libraries.
This was the reason Seattle Housing Authority began looking for a digital asset management solution. Their scattered system of storing assets was slowing the team down.
“We had thousands of images in numerous files and folders on our internal network and in a cloud storage drive,” explains SHA Communications Manager Susanna Linse. “It could take us hours to find photos.”
2. Asset requests are becoming a bottleneck
With a piecemeal system or a disorganized library, one person or team usually becomes the go-to for everyone else to get the files they need. This can be extremely frustrating for the person fielding these requests and dealing with the constant interruptions they create. It’s also not a great system for the people requesting assets, since they’re stuck waiting for someone else to find and retrieve what they need.
That was the dynamic that made Sean Kagawa, Senior Graphic Designer at Yard House, realize his team needed a more sophisticated system. Working with physical lookbooks of the brand’s photo library, Sean was spending hours fielding asset requests for the Yard House marketing team. The team can now self-serve with Canto, eliminating that bottleneck.
“Canto really fulfilled that big wishlist item of having robust ways to download. It allows a lot of people who used to have to work with a designer to get assets to just do it themselves,” says Sean.
3. Your team is growing (and producing more content)
A good digital asset management system makes it easy to keep up with your content and future-proof your media library as your team grows.
Delivery service Favor has relied on Canto throughout their growth from early-stage startup to quickly growing company.
“Canto works smoothly and seamlessly and it’s never been an issue,” explains Nicolai McCrary, Photo Editor at Favor. “As we’ve grown over the past few years, we’ve had to replace a number of other software and services that were too slow. But Canto hasn’t needed to be replaced.”
4. You need to keep track of important metadata
What campaign is this image from, again? Do we have permission to use it?
To get the most out of your assets, you need more than just access to the file. You need information about copyright, approval status, version history and more. A digital asset management solution puts your assets in context, so everyone on your team knows when and how to use them.
Seattle Aquarium decided to invest in digital asset management to make it easier to keep track of digital rights.
“Canto has really helped us in terms of search functionality and metadata. A big thing for me was understanding permission rights for those assets,” explains Pam Lamon, Digital Marketing Manager at the aquarium.
5. Your current system is holding your team back
Ultimately, your digital assets should act as, well… assets, helping to power your team’s success. But if any of the above apply, your digital assets are likely holding your team back. The average team wastes weeks – even months – each year looking for files.
That was the challenge that inspired Falcon Structures to get organized and up their digital asset management game. The company’s marketing team made tons of useful collateral for the sales team, but it was too difficult for sales reps to find what they needed in the company’s disorganized Google Drive.
“It would take us up to half an hour to find the right folder and image in Google Drive, and it added up. Oftentimes, the sales team would just give up searching for an asset,” says Krista Short, Falcon’s Marketing Director.
Now that the team has implemented Canto, the sales team can self-serve and grab assets on the go, even in the field.
By making it easy for people to get the content they need, when they need it, digital asset management helps teams work together and realize their full potential.

March 30, 2020|
With coronavirus transforming the way we work, many organizations are now figuring out how to collaborate remotely. These five pointers will help your team bridge the distance!
1. Make communication count
Now that we’re getting less face time with our colleagues, communication is paramount! Make sure each piece of communication you send to your team is clear and contains everything your teammates need to do their work.
It’s easy to misunderstand cues and tone digitally, so don’t assume that your team will understand what you mean if you use shorthand or give vague instructions. When in doubt, over-communicate and be available to clarify.
2. Practice asynchronous communication
With teams working remotely and possibly spread over time zones, communication may not always happen in real time. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it can be an opportunity to practice clearer communication and help teammates set aside time to focus completely on their work.
Practice asynchronous communication by writing out initial messages that contain all the information a colleague needs to know instead of sending shorter, multiple messages and waiting for a response between each message.
3. Get centralized and organized
To avoid confusion and inefficiency, your team should be on the same page about what workflows look like and where assets are located. Moving to remote work can throw a wrench into marketing and creative operations if brand assets and files aren’t already organized and centralized in a cloud-based location that’s accessible remotely.
Having a centralized location for assets can help your team continue to move quickly and collaborate in real-time. We’ve heard from customers who find having a centralized digital asset library in Canto essential for this remote transition!
“Having to access a shared drive on a server that was half a country away – that lag time was really hard on my work. I would have to lean on team members who were onsite,’” says Marci Falvey, senior director of communications at New World Symphony.
“Canto has really been a game changer for us. It diminishes the cons of not being in the building and takes away the distance. We’re all looking at the same assets at the same time.”
4. Turn on video!
Although you may not want your coworkers to see your WFH outfit and start making bets on when you took your last shower, turning on the video during calls can help teammates communicate better by picking up on nonverbal cues, feel more connected and stay more engaged during meetings. It’s also just nicer to talk to a person rather than a disembodied voice.
5. Show appreciation and recognize each other
It’s even more important as a remote team to celebrate each other’s successes and contributions, so that we all feel appreciated and motivated to continue bringing our best to the team. Take time to nurture both individual connections between teammates and group connections. It can be as simple as acknowledging how a coworker has helped you complete a project, or setting up a Zoom call to celebrate a birthday – but make this a practice so that the team still feels connected despite the distance."

November 13, 2019|
Humans process images 60,000 times faster than text, and the human attention span is only about 8 seconds. With all the information thrown at us daily, it’s no wonder that we’re more receptive to imagery than text.
Here are five ways to harness the power of visuals in your email marketing campaigns.
1. Let your visuals do the talking
To catch the attention of your customer or prospect, use visuals to communicate the main message of your emails.
Create a punchy graphic that quickly tells your email reader that there’s a flash sale, a giveaway or new content offer, rather than losing their attention in a slew of words. It’s the difference between telling your email subscribers that you’re having a ‘huge blowout sale on hundreds of stunning, hand-woven baskets in a multitude of unique patterns and colors’ and just showing them.
2. Use GIFs and videos
OK, so in the age of digital saturation, when everyone and their mother has an iPhone and can take DSLR-quality images, simply having photos in your marketing campaigns is a given, not a guarantee for standing out. Why not catch your customers’ eyes with a little action?
GIFs are a fun way to add interest to an email…but more importantly, they can increase conversion rates by 103 percent. Try creating your own GIFs, such as a product demonstration or how-to, or sharing a relevant meme.
You can also embed videos within emails, but be aware that not all email clients support playback within the email body. One way to get around this is to insert a video thumbnail with a play button that opens up a new tab with the video.
3. Call attention to CTAs with buttons
Don’t just stop at catching your subscriber’s attention with beautiful visuals – go in for the conversion by making sure that your CTA is loud and clear. Create a CTA button that helps it pop from the background of the email by choosing a contrasting color.
4. Build brand recognition with consistency
When a customer opens up your email, they should be able to tell it’s your brand without even looking at the ‘from’ field. Create a consistent experience by including your logo at the top of each email and sticking to the same color palette and tone. Make sure that each team member working on emails is on the same page by creating templates and brand guidelines to follow.
5. A/B test everything!
Don’t forget to A/B test your visual elements, too! Create different graphics, try inserting an image vs. a GIF, and test out different colors and fonts for your CTA buttons to test conversion rates. Then, use the results to further fine-tune your email marketing strategy."

June 24, 2020|
We can’t stress enough the importance of connecting with customers, especially during times of uncertainty. If you prioritize building connections, then customer trust and loyalty strengthens. This results in an all around better B2B relationship.
Here are five strategies for customer connection that you can implement today!
1. Learn their stories
Every team has a different story – listen to it! You’ll have better insight into how they interact with your product day-to-day and how it has changed the way they work. Knowing the whole story equips you to better support customers. And if you have great customers like we do, there might even be a chance to showcase their successes!
2. Ask for feedback
Some customers won’t give feedback until they’re asked, so make sure to ask on a regular basis. This opens a line of communication and helps them feel comfortable sharing their thoughts. Feedback can be gathered through account managers, customer service specialists or even third-party review websites.
3. Personalize communication
Caring about each customer as a person – and not as an account – is necessary to connect. Life exists outside of work! Over time you’ll find that “How are you?” has morphed into “How was your birthday last weekend?” We need to do our jobs efficiently, but there is always time to make a human connection.
4. Use video
While nothing beats face-to-face contact, video communication is the next best thing! When talking with customers, unless a screen share is crucial, the video should be on. This allows for a more personal connection and leaves little room for misunderstanding. There are even backgrounds to make it look like your WFH setup is on the beach or in front of an impressive bookcase!
5. Host virtual events
Events show that your company appreciates the work and interests of its customers. The Canto team hosts a series of (now) virtual events called Canto Connect. These give our customers a unique space to discuss digital asset management, industry trends, goals and wins. Canto Connect events are also prime networking opportunities!
Building customer connection takes time, but if you put in the work, you’ll see relationships flourish!"

A must-follow for the makeup junkie, Ipsy’s Instagram feed showcases just how fun makeup can be! From simple looks to full-on transformations, there’s no shortage of inspiration here.
Imagine the sense of calm you have when you get home after a long day, and everything is perfectly in place. That’s the vibe we get from Blu Dot’s beautiful Instagram, which showcases the clean but cozy minimalism of their furniture designs with a soothing color palette of neutrals and muted colors.
Talk about wanderlust! Palace Resort’s photos feature their drop-dead gorgeous luxury hotels in dreamy destinations such as Cancun, Cozumel and Jamaica, inspiring us to plan that next vacation. BRB, that OOO message isn’t going to draft itself!
We love Sunkist’s bright, tangerine-hued Instagram feed because it’s as refreshing as a cold glass of orange juice! Their account has substance in addition to style, with tons of freshly squeezed recipe ideas.
If you love both travel and interior design, look no further than onefinestay’s feed of ridiculously well-furnished and decorated vacation homes. Seriously, just look – we really can’t do their photos justice with words!
The Ocean Agency’s Instagram gives us a peek into the magical underwater biomes on our planet, reminding us of all there is to explore, learn about and conserve in our oceans. Oh, and their photos and videos are stunning, too!"

November 11, 2019|
We know that a DAM isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution, and that every organization needs flexibility to make their DAM work for their team.
That’s why we’ve built in the ability to customize Canto, from the appearance and branding to the specific keywords that help your team find exactly what they’re looking for.
1. Folder and Album structure
The Folder and Album structure within Canto is fully customizable, so you can set up your library in a way that’s most intuitive to your team. We’ve seen customers organize folders by department, photoshoot date and photographer. Albums are nested inside folders, adding a sub-level of organization that you can also customize.
2. Log-in screen and interface
Customizing your DAM interface helps give your team a consistent, branded experience, so we made our log-in screens customizable. With just a glance at the branded log-in screen, it’s clear to your team that they are in the right place.
You can add your brand’s logo to the upper left hand corner, choose your own background image and brand colors, and even customize the log-in prompt text. In the main library interface, you can also customize the colors and add a logo to the top left corner.
See some of our favorite customized log-in screens here!
3. Portals
Canto Portals allow customers to easily share a portion of their media library via a customizable, branded interface. Whether your portal is for internal use within the team or for external users, such as retailers, agencies or press, Canto’s customization options allow you to create a branded and user-friendly experience. You can customize internal-facing portals to be intuitive for your team and customize external-facing portals to give your partners a professional and consistent experience.
We love how The Honest Kitchen customized their retail portal with custom thumbnails for each category of assets that help users quickly find what they need.
4. Share Links
Even if you share content with a simple Canto share link instead of a portal, how you share this content is completely customizable. When you create a share link, you have the option to add an expiration date and a watermark, and to enable original downloads or a preset download format, choose what information to display and even to require a password.
5. Custom Metadata
Having a well-organized digital asset library where everyone can find what they need is one of the most powerful benefits of a DAM, and organization all comes down to metadata. We know that the metadata that matters varies from team to team, so Canto enables administrators to create custom metadata fields, in addition to setting custom keywords.
Our customers love using Canto’s custom fields to organize their library according to their organization’s unique needs, such as managing digital rights and brand-specific information, like product lines.
6. Watermarks
You can upload and apply a watermark and customize how it appears on photos, and whether you want them to appear in the main library, in portals, or both."
26,https://www.canto.com/blog/aaker-model/,"The Aaker Model: A comprehensive guide to building brand identity
November 9, 2020|
In the world of branding and marketing, it’s not always clear what steps to take next.
If we were to go about understanding things like brand identity, brand loyalty and brand equity without some type of guide, we would end up lost and confused.
Fortunately, a guide does exist to give us some firm ground to stand on. It’s called the Aaker Model, and has been showing the marketers the way for quite some time.
Let’s learn more about it.
What is the Aaker Model?
The Aaker model is a brand blueprint developed by marketing expert David Aaker. It mostly emphasizes the importance of brand identity and offers unique solutions to building a strong brand.
The man who created the model, David Aaker, put forth the ideas in the model in 1996, and the concepts have remained in use even to this day.
The Aaker Model includes four different brand topics: awareness, loyalty, perceived quality and brand associations. These different topics give value to different types of brands.
Now that you have an idea of what the model is, let’s take a look at why it’s so important.
What makes the Aaker Model so valuable?
“A brand vision should attempt to go beyond functional benefits to consider organizational values; a higher purpose; brand personality; and emotional, social, and self-expressive benefits.” – David Aaker
The Aaker Model offers many unique paths to help clarify brand strategies. It provides a foundation for developing a brand identity, showing companies constructing their brand what they should emphasize.
The Aaker Model extends further than other similar models, such as the Keller Equity Model, which is limited to fewer quadrants with fewer descriptions. The Aaker Model gives more leeway for marketers developing campaigns and provides them with more helpful elements.
Another reason the model is valuable is because of the way it can create an adaptable brand, especially if the model is implemented correctly. Remember that your brand should be dynamic, instead of restricted to serving singular purposes or markets. The Aaker Model helps a brand become more expandable.
3 ways you can use the Aaker Model advantageously
Depending on where we are in our branding and marketing journey, we might take different pieces of information away from the Aaker Model, or we might use it differently than others.
Remember that this model is just a blueprint, just a guide. It is only as effective as you allow it to be. The key to using it successfully is gaining a true understanding of its concepts.
No matter what we need from this helpful blueprint, chances are there are some fundamental ways it will help us. Here are three to consider.
Improve your brand persona
The Aaker Model doesn’t directly identify brand persona, though the model aligns with the necessary paths to improving upon it. Brand personas take hold when a brand element, such as a logo, is associated with what it means to be human, like personification for a brand.
By molding your branding strategy to associate emotions, values and kindness with your brand, a persona flourishes. Keep in mind that whatever persona you strive for must be relevant within your brand identity.
An easy way to gauge a brand persona is through descriptive words of the brand. Would customers give human characteristics to your brand, and if so, what would they be?
Help measure market perception of your product
The Aaker Model gives a brief rundown of how your product fuels brand identity. A true measurement of product involves a multi-stage approach, which the model helps piece together in reference.
This approach includes a thorough examination of the way in which the product is perceived, which markets are using it and what kind of characteristics it has.
Also note that the intention a company has for its products don’t always line up with how they’re used by customers, which changes the market outlook.
For example, many sports ‘trading’ cards are never traded, and the pack goes unopened. Hats are not always worn, but hung on a shelf for decoration.
Make sure that you keep an eye on trends, using the Aaker Model as a base to guide your decisions, and embrace the evolution of your product.
Ensure image and symbol consistency
It’s hard to deny the impact images and symbols have on brand identity. By referring to the Aaker Model, you’ll be able to better maintain the solidarity of these symbols, which will improve identity.
Take for example the brand logo. It’s a clear, distinct notifier to all who see it of what the brand behind it stands for. Customers know when they see a particular logo on a product what kind of things to expect from that product in terms of quality, longevity, customer support, etc. Of course, this is just one example.
It’s important to be aware of the many different types of images and symbols used in projects and different marketing campaigns. The Aaker Model acts as a reminder of what types of these visual symbols need to be upheld and consistent across each project.
Now that you have some basic ways to use the model in your favor, let’s take a look at how it can help you understand brand identity better.
How the Model helps further define brand identity
As you now know, the Aaker model is one of the foundations in helping create strong brand identity. Furthermore, it offers a unique breakdown of the different components that makeup brand identity. The model organizes these within four different quadrants:
- Brand as product. This quadrant comprises the outreach of the product, it’s different features, its level of quality and potential value. Also included is the ways it is used, what type of people want it and where it originated geographically.
- Brand as organization. This section contains the different elements attached to the brand organization, in particular, things such as how well people trust it, does it seem forward-moving and any potential negative considerations. It also includes local versus global activities.
- Brand as person. This quadrant is made up of the many different customer and brand relationships, as well as the personality of the brand. This typically includes descriptive traits such as optimistic, caring, customer-oriented, etc.
- Brand as symbol. Included in this section are the different types of branding symbols attached to a brand, such as visual elements, brand history and audio elements.
Putting all of this together, it becomes clear how an understanding of the model leads to a better understanding of improving brand identity.
Closing thoughts on the Model
There is beauty in structure and order, and this beauty is accompanied by effectiveness and efficiency when order elevates a brand.
By following the Aaker Model, at least in some capacity, you clarify likely branding tasks and learn important ideas of what it takes to discover and understand certain brand elements.
After all, sometimes the most helpful thing is as simple as a visual model that guides us from one idea to the next.

Last weekend, I was shopping online for a rain jacket for an upcoming hiking trip. After hours of searching and reading reviews, I found the perfect one and put it in my cart. But when I went to check out, I hesitated. Maybe there was an even better option out there.
I decided to put the decision off for another day and closed the window. In e-commerce terms, I abandoned my cart.
Will I ever buy that jacket? Maybe. But as things stand now, an outdoor brand was very, very close to a sale, but didn’t quite get me over the line.
I’m not alone. E-commerce giant Shopify estimates that 60-80% of shopping carts are abandoned. You read right: 80%. A vast majority of shoppers who put items in their carts never buy them.
Fortunately, there’s a highly effective way for companies to get a good chunk of that revenue back: the abandoned cart email.
In this article, I’ll explain why abandoned cart emails work so well and highlight best practices for writing your own, with fantastic examples from brands that got it right.
What is an abandoned cart email?
An abandoned cart email is a type of automated marketing email. These customized emails are triggered when customers put items in their cart, but don’t complete the check-out process. Abandoned cart emails have high conversion rates, making them one of the highest ROI marketing emails.
Why send abandoned cart emails?
Abandoned cart emails are one of the most effective types of email marketing. It’s easy to understand why. Someone with an abandoned cart has already:
- Discovered your brand
- Developed an interest in your products
- Visited your website
- Stayed on the website
- Picked out at least one product
- Completed the first step to making a purchase
That’s a lot of hurdles already cleared. They know your brand. They’re interested in your products. They’re at least considering making a purchase. Leads don’t get any better than that.
People with abandoned carts just need a one last nudge. They’ve even told you exactly which products they were this close to buying. That makes it easy to create customized, automated emails that highlight exactly the products they find most appealing.
Taking all that into consideration, it’s hardly surprising that automated emails convert like crazy.
One email marketing platform reports that abandoned cart emails usually have a click-through rate around 21%. That’s almost 10 times the average email click-through rate of 2.6%. And it gets even better: A staggering 50% of those clicks result in a sale.
Examples and advice: What makes a good abandoned cart email?
Just because people with abandoned carts are on the verge of making a purchase, doesn’t mean any old email will be enough to convince them. After all, a customer with an abandoned cart is still making up their mind. This moment calls for your best messaging and top-notch copy.
So what boxes do you need to check? Here are a few tips and tricks to make sure your abandoned cart emails are up to scratch.
Understand why people abandon carts
The first step to writing a great abandoned cart email is understanding why people abandon their carts in the first place.
Some of the top reasons are:
Sticker shock – According to research by Shopify, the #1 reason for abandoned carts is sticker shock at check-out. Often this happens because of the cost of tax, shipping or extra processing fees. Or people put several items in their cart and didn’t realize how much they’d add up until they saw the total.
They’ve changed their mind – Even when the total at the bottom of the shopping cart doesn’t come as a surprise, it can still give shoppers pause. As they start checking out, people might remember that vacation they’re saving up for and decide they don’t really need a new pair of shoes or yet another houseplant.
They’re still deciding – They’re still considering a purchase, but they haven’t completely made up their mind yet. This type of shopper is likely still in the research phase. Or they may be wary of impulsive purchases, and waiting to see if they still want the item in a few days.
The wishlist effect – Just as people ‘window shop’ on the street, they sometimes browse e-shops with no intention of buying. Maybe they’re fantasizing about a future purchase they’re still saving up for, or putting together a list of items they’d buy if money were no object. Many online shops offer a wishlist feature for this type of ‘shopping,’ but plenty of people still use their carts instead.
Notice one reason that’s not on this list: forgetfulness. People don’t usually abandon their carts by mistake, so I find it perplexing that so many brands write ‘You forgot something!’ in their abandoned cart emails.
As you’re writing your email, steer clear of this alienating cliche, and keep the real reasons people abandon their carts in mind instead.
Put the product front and center
One of the great things about email marketing is how easy email is to customize, and abandoned cart emails are the perfect opportunity.
When customers put an item in their cart, they’re giving you valuable information about exactly which product they find most appealing. Don’t just remind customers they’ve got something in their cart. Show them exactly what’s waiting for them – the more stunning the photos, the better.
Stay positive
It’s all too easy for abandoned cart emails to slip into a negative tone. ‘Oops, you forgot something’ isn’t the only offender. I’ve seen abandoned cart emails that profess hurt feelings or state that surely your WiFi crashed (Why else would you possibly abandon your cart?!).
Whether written in humor or as a genuine attempt to guilt customers into completing a purchase, negative copy ruins the mood and will put customers off. Instead, keep things light and positive. Enthusiasm for your brand and excitement about your products is the most effective way to draw customers back in.
This email from Everlane is the perfect example:
‘You’ve got great taste’ is fantastic, straightforward copy. It flatters the customer while also placing the product in a good light. Most importantly, it draws people back to their carts without a hint of whininess or desperation.
Paint a vivid picture
One way to reignite customers’ excitement for items left in their cart is to help them imagine what it would be like to own the products they’ve left behind.
This example from J. Crew asks shoppers to picture the items they’re lusting over hanging in their closet:
Lego takes a similar approach with the line ‘Make it yours in a snap!’ This clever choice of words taps into customers’ emotional connection to the product. It calls up tactile memories of playing with Legos, making it easy for shoppers to picture themselves assembling the set they’re thinking of buying.
Highlight key selling points
With customers right on the verge of making a decision, an abandoned cart email is a great time to roll out the big guns and highlight the most convincing selling points for your products. You can list them yourself, or rely on social proof in the form of customer quotes and outside reviews.
That’s what mattress company Casper does in their abandoned cart email:
This excerpt actually comes from my favorite abandoned cart email, which I love for a totally different reason: the headline ‘Come back to bed.’ Now that’s some genius email copy!
Sweeten the deal
If you want to be extra convincing in your abandoned cart email, consider a little extra incentive. Free shipping or a discount code could be just the thing to convince people who abandoned their carts due to price concerns to reconsider.
A twist on this idea is an abandoned cart email triggered not when the shopper abandons their cart, but when the items in their cart go on sale:
Create a sense of urgency (or security)
A common tactic in abandoned cart emails is fostering a sense of urgency. If the desired item might sell out, the customer is motivated to act now. This has roots in basic psychology. Not only is there logistical time pressure, but scarce items inherently seem more valuable.
Here’s an email from the Google Store that puts this strategy into action:
However, the urgency approach isn’t universal. Other brands go in the complete opposite direction, telling customers their items are saved for them in their cart. This fosters a feeling of ownership of the abandoned product and projects an image of great customer service.
Here’s an example:
How should you decide which method to use? It’s easy: whichever applies. If you really might sell out, give customers a heads up, so they can get it while they can. If not, simply let your customers know that when they’re ready to pull the trigger, that cool coat rack will be waiting for them.
Make abandoned cart emails work for your brand
Abandoned cart emails are a valuable (and underutilized) type of marketing email. Not only do they convert insanely well, they also take advantage of some of the biggest benefits of email marketing, like customization and precision timing.
This provides a positive, personalized experience, meaning you benefit twice: immediately with a sale, and long-term from the customer loyalty that comes from a stronger relationship with your brand.
Because they rely on advanced features like email automation and custom content fields, abandoned cart emails can seem intimidating at first. But chances are, the email service provider and e-commerce tools you already use offer features that make it easy to set them up. And with double-digit conversion rates, doing so is well worth the effort.
So let the examples above inspire you, get your creative juices flowing and go write some killer abandoned cart emails of your own."

October 26, 2022|
Adobe MAX 2022, a global in-person and virtual conference designed for creatives, was a sensational success with over 131 million total views from over 264,000 virtual attendees and 7,500 in-person creatives live in Los Angeles. The feeling at MAX was one of engagement, stimulation, and overall intellectual curiosity as teams chatted amongst themselves and with organizations on how they work and how to use creative tools to push the boundaries of design and design thinking.
Canto was primely positioned to be part of those conversations as a hub for their content supply chain, alleviating common creative workflow issues and making content production easier for organizations. Canto also showcased the newest Adobe integrations, including Lightroom Classic and After Effects, in addition to our existing integrations with InDesign, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and Illustrator.
We asked our team on-site about their Adobe MAX experience and key takeaways.
Overall impressions of Adobe MAX 2022
Everyone on the team felt Adobe MAX was incredible and exceeded all expectations. The attendees were curious about the latest and greatest tools to make creative work seamless, and they were delighted to find out more about Canto and digital asset management in general.
“I have never seen a more intellectually curious group of people,” said Canto’s Ariana Keil, Growth Marketing Manager, North America. “Everyone who came by our booth was genuinely curious about what we do, whether they had ever heard of DAM platforms or not.”
Big announcements at Adobe MAX
There were lots of cool features hinted at in this year’s Adobe Sneaks, a special moment during MAX that all fans especially look forward to which includes features that may or may not appear in final Adobe products. These features would save creatives lots of time, increase productivity, and improve the quality of their work.
One of those Sneaks was on an innovative feature called Project Magnetic Type, which was an exciting announcement for Daniel Bryan, Canto’s Senior Corporate Communications Manager. “It could help streamline the editing process for graphic designers by alleviating a lot of tedious repositioning and alignment issues.”
And there was buzz around Adobe’s Frame.io integration for anyone working with video using Premiere Pro or After Effects. “Teams can move footage straight from on-set to the editing process faster than ever before,” noted Kate Bennewitz, Canto’s Senior Product Marketing Manager.
Standout session for remote teams at Adobe MAX
As teams continue to adjust to the post-pandemic hybrid workforce, session topics such as “This Is How We Work Now: Establishing a Remote Work Culture” have become increasingly popular and incredibly helpful. In the session by Upwork’s Patrick Holly, trust, open communication, and the appropriate tools were at the top of the list to streamline workflows for hybrid or remote teams.
Creatives were very receptive as they took what they learned to organizations such as Canto to see how they could help them with friction points for remote team technology. “Canto provides a solution that is incredibly helpful to remote creative and marketing teams that are working with large volumes of image, video, and document assets,” mentioned Julie Neumeister, Canto’s Customer Marketing Manager.
Creatives visited Canto’s booth in droves
More people visited Canto’s booth than our team could have anticipated —attendees loved Canto and had a genuine interest in digital asset management, what it provided, and the vibe at Canto’s booth. Customers were calling Canto a “lifesaver”—talking to others about how Canto helps with workflow issues such as poor storage size, lack of version control, file permission issues, as well as integrating within the tools they use and love most.
“Creatives love the idea of never having to leave the Adobe CC app they are working within to search their whole library,” mentioned Ariana. And with Canto, customers can do just that due to Canto’s ever-expanding Adobe integrations.
Biggest Adobe MAX takeaways
Consistent innovation and remote collaboration were very important to the creatives that our team spoke with. To that end, Canto is constantly innovating by adding more robust features to our core DAM solution and new integrations regularly where creatives work and play.
And the best part? DAM creates a content hub for teams working anywhere and anytime, so your team can focus on creative work in Adobe apps instead of busywork."

April 27, 2020|
Artificial intelligence continues to evolve and move advertising potential forward. In order to fully utilize this inevitable trend, make sure your company advertisements incorporate the powerful elements of AI as much as possible. This article demonstrates some of the key ways AI is already overhauling advertising and how you can use it.
Artificial intelligence explained
We all have some general idea of artificial intelligence and how it works. It’s clear by now that AI is, on a very basic level, intelligence shown by machines. Essentially, it is a machine branching off from humans intellectually.
It’s important to have a clear understanding of AI in order to move forward with the ways in which it can help your company. Because everyone has their own idea of AI, here’s an example to unify interpretations:
Artificial intelligence is NOT when a machine emulates human behaviors. Just because a machine is programmed to calculate the way a human brain does, this doesn’t make it AI.
Instead, artificial intelligence is when a machine changes and improves upon the way it emulates human behavior. Keep this difference in mind throughout your experience with AI to better utilize the technology.
Creative input
Heavy AI involvement in creative ads seems counter-intuitive. It has been widely observed and accepted that humans thrived in creativity while AI lagged behind. Though this is still the case in a lot of areas, the gap has closed. Also, people are finding that AI is useful in bolstering ad creativity. When combined with human ingenuity, AI is more than capable of producing unique, groundbreaking advertisements.
The most important creative example to point to is a popular Lexus commercial that was written entirely by artificial intelligence (but directed by a human, of course). The ad begins with a man sending out a newly-designed Lexus car for testing. He watches nervously as the vehicle safely brakes before hitting a truck. Overall, the commercial is solid. It’s definitely different than a lot of ads humans make, but it’s possible that viewers would believe it was written by a human. The interesting part of the ad is how the AI went about writing the script. It compiled data based on previous ad-winning films and used common themes to create its story. Ultimately, this was just one step of many in the direction of AI and its creative input.
Analysis and refinement
Similar to the way the machines found data from previous films to create the Lexus commercial, this method also changes the way companies evaluate their advertisement success. AI systems are able to gather and sift through large quantities of information in a very short term, allowing them to quickly evaluate results.
The logical result of this is a company with more focused future campaigns. The AI-based research not only gives detailed analysis on what’s working and what isn’t, but it also gives team members more freedom to work on important advertisement tasks rather than research their previous performances on their own. In a larger sense, this powerful concept extends further than advertising. In fact, AI in digital marketing has become a reality as well.
Where to begin?
Now that you understand the direction AI is taking advertising in the near future, structure a plan to incorporate it into your company’s campaigns. The first thing to do is research which type of AI systems are available and which have extensive tools for creating ads. It’s important to find one that best suits your needs, but I’ll recommend Adobe to give an initial system to consider. They have their own unique AI program, Sensei, that feeds teams information and guides advertising processes using efficient data analysis.
Once you find the right AI system, optimize it to boost advertisements in new and exciting ways. The possibilities are truly endless with artificial intelligence."

January 2, 2020|
The AI image file is a staple in the landscape of popular graphic file extensions. For businesses, its flexibility and scalability make it stand out as an elite image type. For users, it offers more than enough tools to edit even the more complicated projects. Learn how using it extensively could boost your efficiency.
What is the AI image file?
The AI image file is a highly scalable Adobe Illustrator file extension which uses a rare type of graphic – vector. Vector graphics are connected by points, which have precise indicators to determine different image factors. Users can resize AI images without losing image quality.
The AI is used when companies need to build brand logo graphics, create unique text placements on images and work with photographs or drawings. It is a high resolution file type with numerous business advantages. Here are some key issues to consider.
Image scalability
Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics program, which makes the AI files mathematical model of images. Because of this, original image quality remains unblemished throughout any necessary size manipulation. This is important because enterprises shape images such as logos often throughout campaigns.
AI image file types are scalable, which means they expand and compress while maintaining high resolution. Companies can then change design templates with no penalty. This comes in handy during marketing campaigns that require different formats of flyers, brochures and newsletters. For example, if a company logo was large on a newsletter but small on a flyer, it would be crucial that the logo quality remained constant.
When should I use an AI image file?
If you’re a business who produces printed campaign projects, the AI should meet a lot of your needs. Most printed media changes to accommodate different sizes, therefore the size of the images shrink and expand. These modifications typically take place across different print media such as books, newsletters and brochures.
Another time where AI is beneficial for companies is when creating or editing logos. A brand logo is subject to change proportions throughout different campaigns. And because it has to stay true to its original intent to maintain brand consistency, the AI is a perfect choice.
Alternative image file options
The AI file has some great features but it might not be right for you. It’s tied to Adobe Illustrator but some users and businesses don’t have access to the Adobe Creative Cloud. The initial implementation of the AI is restricted unless the system already has Adobe software in place. It’s also a timely investment, due to the difficulty users have learning the program.
AI files take up a lot of space. For companies using a cloud storage system like digital asset management, this is fine. For those who aren’t, you might end up trading image quality for storage space. Finally, some companies are stifled by the lack of editing in Illustrator. When this is the case, seek out a few alternatives.
The AI image file type boosts marketing campaigns, branding materials and business. Consider using it universally within your organization. It also provides a great format for editing and sharing. If you’re an individual working on a project, it should fit your needs perfectly."
32,https://www.canto.com/blog/ai-in-digital-marketing/,"AI in digital marketing – 3 powerful benefits
March 10, 2020|
The power of AI is growing rapidly! Digital marketers have already begun finding innovative ways to implement it into their applications. As artificial intelligence evolves, chances are it will be involved in a lot more digital marketing schemes, projects and campaigns. Here are three ways AI has drastically reformed the landscape of digital marketing.
1. Digital customer connection
The idea of AI connecting with customers seems backwards. Common wisdom suggests that human touch is necessary to make powerful campaigns that connect with other people. Well, that’s all in the past now. Artificial intelligence has given companies the chance to focus in on specific markets and efficiently target audiences that will have a higher percentage chance to connect with the business.
One example of this is with analysis of campaign projects. With all the data and different forms of information AI is able to go over quickly, it’s able to help us shape our new digital marketing campaigns to better serve potential customers. Let’s say that a company compiled a collection of data based on a page on their business website. It brought in information such as how many people clicked, at what time of the day, what ages they were, etc. With AI, this data is quickly compiled and then used to recommend which types of tasks would best reach customers. The same thing applies to other tasks and processes as well, such as email campaigns.
2. Extensive handling of content
Similar to the idea of AI connecting with humans, content is also an area where it seems strange to think that AI would be able to handle the creative aspects required to impact content positively for companies. However, as we’re seeing recently, AI is helping businesses create and manage content effectively. Even though the content creation technology of AI is in its infancy, that doesn’t stop it from delivering things like keywords to companies to suggest titles and headers for new articles and blog posts.
On top of delivering new ideas for content that will attract the right customers, AI is capable of managing company content efficiently. This usually involves working with each new digital marketing creation, such as an article, social media post, etc. and organizing them in a fashion that suits specific customers. If AI is delivering relevant content to your customers, half the battle is already won. Add the power of AI to your arsenal and boost your existing technology tools, such as your enterprise content management systems.
3. Smarter chatbots
A lot of companies have already discovered and benefited from the chatbot technology. They provide efficient, life-like customer service without any human requirement. Chatbots don’t require any type of continued pay, either. As the chatbot never sleeps, businesses are able to keep up with all types of customer requests at all times of the day.
Now, digital marketers are discovering how important chatbots have become as well. Aside from what a chatbot can represent (a company that is technologically-proficient and adaptive), it also helps draw sales from numerous different marketing channels. This performance continues to expand each year.
With the overwhelming benefits for digital marketing teams, it’s clear that utilizing AI boosts performance and productivity. Obviously, the level of artificial intelligence that teams will employ remains a decision of preference. Having said that, it’s becoming more and more apparent that the more AI marketers are able to effectively use, the better suited they’ll be to tackle the tasks of tomorrow."
33,https://www.canto.com/blog/alt-attribute/,"The easiest, most comprehensive alt attribute guide
November 27, 2019|
An alt attribute can make or break a webpage, so make sure you learn all there is to know about them. It might seem complex at first but it’s not. If you read through this article, you’ll understand them completely and know how to implement them on your own website.
What is an alt attribute?
An alt attribute is the HTML image attribute that clarifies alt text which defines elements in the event of an undeliverable element. Users building a webpage or blog input alt attributes on images, clarifying the picture’s different qualities and characteristics. An alt attribute makes each image accessible, even if it is created without text.
The alt attribute is mainly utilized by screen reader software that speaks the text, describing the element to someone who is listening to the makeup of the webpage. Typically, this is used by someone who is visually impaired, giving them full understanding of the webpage – especially pictures. The following picture provides an example of an alt attribute:
For anyone using this picture to build a website, they’ll need to input alt attributes for the image. Let’s say they chose to describe the picture like this: “A golden dog sticks his head out of the car window to smell green fields.” These words are what would be read by the screen reader software when this picture appears on a webpage.
The HTML for the image would look something like this:
src=“http:www.picturesofdoggies.com/cardogs.jpg” alt=“A golden dog sticks his head out of the car window to smell green fields.”
How to add an alt attribute
Once you’ve decided on an image and a descriptor for that image, you’ll need to correctly add your description as an alt attribute. Luckily, most content management systems make it easy to do so. For example, if you’re using the WordPress software to build your site, all you need to do is locate the page you wish to add alt attributes to and edit them.
- In the admin/editing section of the page you wish to add to, find the image you want to add an alt attribute on
- Click the image and select ‘Edit’ (it’s the pencil icon)
- In the window that pops up, enter your descriptive text in the ‘Alternative Text’ space
- Be as descriptive as possible. Remember, you’re writing this for someone who won’t see the image
- Click the blue ‘Update’ button in the bottom right-hand corner
- Now simply publish the new page and your alt attribute will be included
Do alt attributes affect SEO?
The alt attribute and its accuracy absolutely affects SEO. For those who are unfamiliar with SEO, it is Search Engine Optimization and it determines how visible your webpage will be in a search engine. In order to create a webpage that has strong SEO, it needs an informative, accurate text attached to each image.
The images you place on a webpage are very important because they add or detract from the written content on the page. Similarly, the alt attributes strengthen (or weaken, depending on how well you write it) your webpage according to the search engine algorithms. They also improve the overall accessibility of your website, which keeps more people visiting it and staying to read pages.
The first step in this entire process is knowing why they exist. Once you’ve got that down, it’s time to input your own. If you follow these steps and use accurate descriptors, your alt texts will increase the overall success of your website."
34,https://www.canto.com/blog/amazon-s3-image-hosting/,"A guide to using Amazon S3 for enterprise image hosting
January 9, 2020|
Amazon S3 provides companies with an efficient way to store images. Do you know how to use it? Do you understand what types of benefits it provides? If not, this article is for you. Here’s a breakdown of the steps needed to set it up and what it can do for your business.
How to use Amazon S3 for image hosting
In order to begin storing your images on Amazon S3, you need to first create an account with AWS. Finish the verification process as well before you go any further. Once you’ve completed these two steps, navigate to the S3 portion of AWS. To do this, click the ‘services’ dropdown menu and then click ‘S3’. Next, click the ‘Create Bucket’ button in the top left and name it (I recommend you name it something that is recognizable for your company).
Now it’s time to upload your images onto S3. Locate the bucket you’ve created (it will be named what you entered in the above step) and click on it. Select the ‘Upload’ button in the upper left of the screen and either click ‘add files’ and select your photos, or simply drag the desired photos to the drag and drop area.
Why use Amazon S3?
Amazon S3 offers scalable storage that lets businesses store and manage endless amounts of items in the cloud. It not only offers huge storage allowance but it does so with extremely fast speeds, allowing users to quickly retrieve and share their stored images. It’s widely known that AWS is extremely secure, ensuring that each image stored is under extremely safe protocols and security checks.
Another good reason to use Amazon S3 is the cost convenience. In comparison to similar systems, the price is generally favorable. More importantly, however, is the way it caters to the cost needs of companies. It does this by only making customers pay for what they use, a practical solution for businesses worried about overpaying for cloud storage space they might not utilize.
Who needs S3 and some alternatives
Businesses, especially larger enterprises, could really benefit from Amazon S3 image hosting. This is particularly true for companies who deal with large amounts of photographs, graphics and other image types. Companies that work with a lot of photographers are a good example of a company that requires cloud storage like amazon S3. Furthermore, companies who share a lot of images would benefit from amazon S3’s fast speeds, as they would allow businesses to quickly retrieve and share files.
What about an alternative to Amazon S3 for image hosting? If you’re looking for a cloud solution that has enterprise-features that offers some different benefits, consider digital asset management (DAM). The reason it’s such a good alternative to Amazon S3 is it has similar enterprise features, such as scalability and fast speeds for sharing. The way it differentiates is by giving companies extensive metadata features and team collaboration tools. Check out DAM if you want a different type of image hosting.
With the rise of things like company websites, there are more and more images needed, such as logos and photos for webpages. Because of this, companies need image hosting that is specific to their needs as an enterprise. Keep Amazon S3 in mind if you have a growing need for photos in your daily work."
35,https://www.canto.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-asset-management/,"Artificial intelligence, an innovation for DAM
August 31, 2017|
Artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally alter the way we deal with technology. Facebook already announced that it wants systems that recognize and tag images faster and better than humans. And in April 2017, Mark Zuckerberg announced at the annual developer conference that he wants to implement a function that can explain to blind people what is on a display. For digital asset management (DAM), AI will change workflows through auto tagging and image recognition.
Artificial intelligence – The new DAM employee
To get the most out of a digital asset management system, all assets must be organized and identified in detail. The DAM system literally lives through its use and using images without categorizing and tagging them is a recipe for digital chaos. Categorizing and tagging images is hard work and management often doesn’t appreciate its added value. Subsequently, DAM systems in companies don’t often actuate their full potential.
This situation changes with artificial intelligence as a new ‘employee’. An ‘intelligent DAM’ automatically identifies images and give companies of almost any size access to the full potential of their digital asset management systems.
Additional functionality through artificial intelligence in DAM systems
- Object detection: AI automatically detects objects such as dogs, cars, grass, etc. and tags images in the database correspondingly
- Similar image search: After uploading the initial image, the algorithm looks for comparable assets in the company’s DAM
- Face detection: Image search can find people in a group of images based off face detection technology
- Famous landmarks can be automatically recognized and tagged in images
Canto DAM has AI features like image recognition and auto tagging.
Product pictures are a challenge
While images with general or human-related content can now be identified quite well based on available pictures, product images represent a challenge for artificial intelligence. In order for algorithms to be able to differentiate between a hexagon head screw and a round head screw, they must be specially trained. For companies this is usually done via their own data stocks, which they import and train into the systems.
Artificial intelligence in DAM is in the early stages
The automation of image recognition processes is only the beginning for artificial intelligence in digital asset management systems. Intelligent algorithms have triggered a trend that leads to new interfaces and fundamental changes to the nature of human-machine interaction. Amazon Alexa, for example, creates audio interfaces for everyone in everyday information services. Chatbots are already superior FAQ pages and resources for routine queries.
In the future, DAM systems could also process voice commands in real-time thanks to automatic tagging and machine learning. During a presentation, for example, a marketing executive might pair an infographic with current visitor statistics on the website without having to upload or tag the material beforehand. The possibilities offered by intelligent algorithms are almost infinite. But one thing is clear: digital asset management will also change with artificial intelligence and work closer with professional users."

May 6, 2020|
Artificial intelligence is popping up everywhere, giving companies more and more ways to streamline their processes.
As we see new and exciting ways artificial intelligence handles different tasks, there comes a strong need for ways to handle and maintain these systems. This is where artificial intelligence management enters into the equation.
Having the right systems and scheduled tasks is only half the battle when attempting to implement AI successfully. Learn here how artificial intelligence management accomplishes this.
What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is when a computer, robot or machine does something that typically requires human intelligence. It further is able to change and react to new issues as they arise. Even though AI is still limited, it’s a rapidly-evolving field that has many new systems available to change the way companies operate.
Note that AI isn’t quite the same as machine learning. Make sure you understand the difference between AI and machine learning.
How do companies use artificial intelligence today?
AI is a massive time-saver, helping companies sort through endless amounts of data in short periods of time. It seems like tedious tasks such as this are what most companies are using artificial intelligence for. However, recent developments have created new enterprise capabilities for all different types of processes. Remember that even though not every company uses AI in the same manner, they all require similar types of artificial intelligence management.
One of the more common ways companies have begun to explore AI is with chatbots. The idea is quite simple: you replace the need for human interaction with a helpful machine that knows everything there is to know about a company. This way, whenever a customer has a question, the chatbot can answer it. In fact, it usually can answer questions faster than a human representative could. Lastly, the AI chatbot doesn’t get tired or need any breaks, so they’re always available to help. This is just one of many ways AI has helped companies today.
How will AI management change in the future?
It’s clear that AI will continue to improve and advance upon itself as time goes on. Because of this, artificial intelligence management will need to adapt to these changes, focusing on all types of ways it can better maintain and accelerate AI systems for companies. Whether this is accomplished through different software systems are scheduled evaluations, there needs to be some sort of plan in place.
One key process that will need continuous evaluation is the upkeep of different departments’ AI technology and use. The only way to truly find success with evolving technology is to stay on top of the ways it will evolve and how these changes will affect each department. Most of all, keep in mind that AI is used for so many different company benefits now. It has the potential to boost customer service, locate and create immense data and analyze company finances. The only way to sync these processes and unify toward a specific goal is through efficient artificial intelligence management.
Is there software available or in development?
Fortunately, when it comes to artificial intelligence management software, it feels like the future is already here. That’s because there are a lot of different management systems that implement AI processes to accomplish important tasks. Keep in mind there are different types of systems, some manage the AI output specifically, while others manage digital items with the assistance of AI.
To demonstrate this further, we’ll quickly breakdown both of these types of artificial intelligence management systems. The first kind exists as a way to sync up and optimize the types of AI a company has in-place. So, if a company uses artificial intelligence chatbots, their management system would evaluate the bots’ AI traits. It would then make adjustments to optimize them. The other type of artificial intelligence management software would be a system that manages certain tasks or data while using AI to assist them. For example, digital asset management is an enterprise-based media storage system, which uses powerful AI to develop and deliver efficient auto-tagging and image recognition. Whichever the case, it’s not hard to see which type of AI management system is right for your company.
Whether you need to automate your company’s AI lifecycle, or boost existing company-based AI systems, some type of artificial intelligence management is a necessity. Stay on top of this growing requirement in order to succeed."
37,https://www.canto.com/blog/audio-file-types/,"7 popular audio file types to consider
April 30, 2020|
Each audio file type has unique benefits and drawbacks. Determine which one is best for specific tasks or situations to save time and reduce stressful errors. Here are seven popular audio file types and some unique differences between them.
1. M4A audio file type
The M4A is an mpeg-4 audio file. It is an audio-compressed file used in the modern setting due to increased quality demand as a result of cloud storage and bigger hard drive space in contemporary computers. Its high quality keeps it relevant, as users who need to hear distinct sounds on audio files will need this over more common file types.
Music download software like Apple iTunes use M4A instead of MP3 because it’s smaller in size and higher in quality. Its limitations come in the form of compatibility, as a lot of software are unable to recognize the M4A, making it ideal for only a select type of user.
2. FLAC
The FLAC audio file is Free Lossless Audio Codec. It is an audio file compressed into a smaller size of the original file. It’s a sophisticated file type that is lesser-used among audio formats. This is because, even though it has its advantages, it often needs special downloads to function. When you consider that audio files are shared often, this can make for quite an inconvenience to each new user who receives one.
What makes the FLAC so important is the lossless compression can save size and promote sharing of an audio file while being able to return to the original quality standard. The near-exact amount of storage space required of the original audio file is sixty percent – this saves a lot of hard drive space and time spent uploading or downloading.
3. MP3
The MP3 audio file is an MPEG audio layer 3 file format. The key feature of MP3 files is the compression that saves valuable space while maintaining near-flawless quality of the original source of sound. This compression makes the MP3 very popular for all mobile audio-playing devices, particularly the Apple iPod.
MP3 continues to be relevant in today’s digital landscape because it’s compatible with nearly every device capable of reading audio files. The MP3 is probably best used for extensive audio file sharing due to its manageable size. It also works well for websites that host audio files. Finally, the MP3 remains popular because of its overall sound quality. Though not the highest quality, it has enough other benefits to compensate.
4. MP4
An MP4 audio file is often mistaken as an improved version of the MP3 file. However, this couldn’t be further from the truth. The two are completely different and the similarities come from their namesake rather than their functionality. Also note that the MP4 is sometimes referred to as a video file instead of an audio file. This isn’t an error, as in fact it’s both an audio and video file.
An MP4 audio file type is a comprehensive media extension, capable of holding audio, video and other media. The MP4 contains data in the file, rather than code. This is important to note as MP4 files require different codecs to implement the code artificially and allow it to be read.
5. WAV
A WAV audio file is a Waveform Audio File that stores waveform data. The waveform data stored presents an image that demonstrates strength of volume and sound in specific parts of the WAV file. It is entirely possible to transform a WAV file using compression, though it’s not standard. Also, the WAV is typically used on Windows systems.
The easiest way to envision this concept is by thinking of ocean waves. The water is loudest, fullest and strongest when the wave is high. The same holds true for the waveform in the WAV. The visuals are high and large when the sound increases in the file. WAV files are usually uncompressed audio files, though it’s not a requirement of the format.
6. WMA
The WMA (Windows Media Audio) is a Windows-based alternative to the more common and popular MP3 file type. What makes so beneficial is its lossless compression, retaining high audio quality throughout all types of restructuring processes. Even though it’s such a quality audio format, it’s not the most popular due to the fact it’s inaccessible to many users, especially those who don’t use the Windows operating system.
If you’re a Windows user, simply double-click any WMA file to open it. The file will open with Windows Media Player (unless you’ve changed the default program). If you’re not using Windows, there are some alternatives to help you out. The first option is to download a third-party system that plays the WMA. If this isn’t something you want to do, consider converting the WMA to a different audio format. There are plenty of conversion tools available.
7. AAC
The AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) is an audio file that delivers decently high-quality sound and is enhanced using advanced coding. It has never been one of the most popular audio formats, especially when it comes to music files, but the AAC does still serve some purpose for major systems. This includes popular mobile devices and video gaming units, where the AAC is a standard audio component.
To open an AAC file, the most common and direct format for most users is through iTunes. All this entails is launching the iTunes system and opening the AAC file from your computer in the ‘File’ menu. If you don’t have iTunes and want an alternative, consider downloading third-party software capable of opening the AAC. If that doesn’t suit your needs, convert the AAC to a more common audio file type.
Master your understanding of the trade offs between audio file types to optimize specific audio file libraries. Strong audio file benefit and functionality knowledge boosts efficiency. If you need to organize your audio files, Canto digital asset management does the trick."
38,https://www.canto.com/blog/benefits-of-email-marketing/,"Benefits of email marketing: Why email is still a great way to reach your customers
November 18, 2020|
Once the cutting edge of digital communications, email is now a bit old-fashioned. So why is it still such a popular marketing channel, even for the most modern brands?
While digital ads, social media and paid search all have their place, email marketing has several qualities that make it unique – and (as of yet) irreplaceable. Email is simply still the best way to get certain types of messages to certain types of customers.
If you’re thinking of adding email campaigns to your marketing strategy, or just trying to understand what email brings to the table, here are 11 benefits of email marketing you’ll want to consider.
1. It’s a direct line to your most engaged customers
Email marketing is possibly the only kind of marketing people ask to receive. Customers who sign up to a mailing list are sending a pretty clear signal: they want to hear from you. That’s the kind of audience marketers dream of. They’re warmed up and receptive to what you have to say.
Even contacts who didn’t directly sign up for a newsletter, but purchased a product or filled out a lead generation form, have shown that they’re engaged. In one survey, 91% of people said they want to receive promotional emails from companies they do business with.
2. Email is intimate
Voice, identity, persona – there’s a reason we talk about brands as if they were people. Every interaction helps build a personal relationship with customers. With every email you send, your brand is beaming itself into customers’ homes, offices and pockets. That intimate setting offers a unique opportunity to connect with each customer in a place where they feel comfortable.
3. But not too intimate
Email is a natural channel for business communications. People know to look for order confirmations in their inbox, so it makes sense that they’ll find promotions, newsletters and other marketing communication there too.
That’s especially important for B2B marketing. Someone scrolling through Instagram or Facebook probably doesn’t want to think about work right now. They might even resent being reminded of a business problem when they were just looking to escape into a world of vacation snapshots and pet photos.
That doesn’t mean B2B social media ads are never a good idea. After all, you don’t have everyone’s email address, and people have to discover you somewhere. Still, work email inboxes have the advantage of being a ‘strictly business’ zone, where you’re more likely to reach people already thinking about the problem you’re there to solve.
4. Emails are easy to customize
You can’t put up a custom billboard for every driver on the highway, though Mini USA once made a remarkable effort using signals from drivers’ key fobs. Fortunately, customizing emails is a much easier (and less creepy) way to personalize marketing content. That makes email the perfect channel to connect with customers as individuals.
Putting first names in the subject line is a classic approach, but it’s far from the only option. You can also customize content based on location, recent purchase history or even personalized data insights.
A great example is Spotify’s annual end-of-year email, which looks back at each customer’s year in music. These personal wrap-ups drum up positive memories and connect people’s love of music with the Spotify brand.
5. You control the timing and cadence
When you need to time a message just right, email is a great tool for the job.
A media company can easily set an email newsletter to go out during rush hour, when people are stuck on the train and desperate for something to read. Similarly, a food delivery app could highlight their downtown lunch deals at noon, and advertise restaurants in residential areas in the evening.
Although you can also schedule digital ads on some platforms, it’s not quite as precise. Plus, you’ll only reach people using the platform at that time. Emails generate push notifications, reaching a wider audience with pinpoint accurate timing.
Email marketing also makes it easy to dial in the perfect email cadence. A purchase can trigger automated campaigns, so customers get helpful tips and tutorials at just the right time. Or you can nurture leads during a free trial, so people don’t forget to use it.
6. Measuring engagement is easy
Email marketing is blissfully quantifiable. With click rates, open rates and other metrics, every campaign generates helpful data you can use to measure success.
Sure, other kinds of digital marketing also track clicks and impressions. However, email marketing is right up there among the channels that offer the most advanced analytics. A/B testing and other tools make email campaign optimization easy, so you know exactly where you stand and how to improve.
7. It’s inexpensive
Compared to other types of marketing, email campaigns are relatively inexpensive, especially at scale. Digital ads are essentially another company selling you their audience. That means you’ll reach people you otherwise wouldn’t, but it also means the other company takes a cut.
With email, you’re marketing to your audience. The only cost is what you invest in designing the campaign, and possibly a subscription to an email marketing tool.
Plus, email marketing doesn’t require paying per click, so you don’t have to pay more for better performance. As you improve your email campaigns over time, you can enjoy more conversions at no additional cost.
8. Email marketing works at any scale
Email marketing is an effective marketing channel for any business, from multinational corporations to small-town bookstores and local restaurants.
Plus, email marketing is incredibly scalable. As you grow your list of subscribers, you reach more and more people with the same amount of effort.
9. There’s no barrier to entry
Dedicated email marketing platforms like Mailchimp and their competitors are relatively inexpensive and make the process easy – even for beginners. Starting at only $10-20 per month, these tools have made email marketing accessible, even to small businesses without dedicated marketing teams or trained marketers on staff.
You can always improve your email marketing by learning more about email analytics, email design and other best practices. But features like customizable templates and easy-to-understand analytics dashboards mean you don’t have to learn everything there is to know about email marketing to get started.
10. You can think outside the box
Because the people on your mailing list are your most engaged customers, you can use email for more than traditional marketing. Email campaigns can even help amplify your efforts on other channels. For example, you could ask your email subscribers to leave a review on review sites, boosting your reach there. After all, anyone who signed up to your mailing list probably likes your brand – the odds of a glowing review are in your favor.
11. It’s the perfect testing ground for brand identity decisions
Your email marketing should have a consistent style and voice that follow your company’s brand style guide. However, if you’re still in the process of creating those guidelines, the influence can flow in the other direction.
Decisions about any brand’s voice and personality should be based in part on intuition, but also on hard data. Should your brand be serious or funny? A look back at email engagement rates can help answer that question. If people engage more with playful emails, that’s a good indication that your customers appreciate a bit of whimsy.
That doesn’t mean you should go wild in the name of experimentation. You don’t want to surprise people with a totally different personality in every email. But if you need data on subtle changes in tone, A/B testing an email campaign is a great way to gather some.
Final thoughts
Email is certainly no longer the only digital tool in marketers’ tool belts. Digital advertising, social media and paid search have all opened up new opportunities to reach potential customers. However with so many unique benefits of email marketing, it’s clear why email is still a key part of most brands’ marketing strategies.
As you consider how to allocate your marketing resources, take email’s relative advantages into account. That way, you can make sure your efforts on every channel align with what that channel does best."

December 24, 2019|
One of the most important rules to remember when working with something, especially digital technology, is it’s going to fail at some point. Whether it’s today, tomorrow or years from now, it is truly inevitable. When the inevitable happens, it’s vital we have a plan to make sure we’re protected. When it comes to backing up things of digital value, such as data, information and our computer files, this rule becomes a golden one. Computers are extremely vulnerable to failure, both in terms of hardware and software.
As the amount of data we retain increases, it becomes more and more necessary to find a backup software system to protect our data and files. If you’re not sure where to start, this list is a perfect foundation. The following are the top four best backup software systems available.
1. Acronis
Acronis is an absolute must when considering a backup system. It has consistently adapted to users’ evolving needs, all while maintaining a quality that is unrivaled by other software tools. The biggest draw to Acronis comes in the form of it’s backup process. This process gives the option of backing up files to the desires of the user – to the cloud or onto a resident system.
Some important details to consider about Acronis is they do an annual release of new software systems. The most recent form, True Image 2020, has all the upgrades you would expect from such a revolutionary company. It’s accessible for most users, compatible on both Windows and Mac. It has plenty of special features as well as backup tools that extend further than ordinary backup benefits. The most notable new update is to the file deletion tool, a great way to save space around data you’re backing up.
2. ShadowProtect
ShadowProtect is an ingenious enterprise backup system, valuing first and foremost the idea that company downtime is completely devastating and entirely avoidable (in some circumstances). As everyone knows, there are plenty of systems and operations that can’t immediately recover files if something goes wrong. However, ShadowProtect ensures that when disaster strikes, the downtime is lessened.
Another thing I really like about ShadowProtect is the simplistic, smooth interface that puts all the necessary restoration tools in logical places that are easy to find and operate. Finally, the biggest standout of this tool is how basic yet effective it is. Users of all technical levels are able to locate the tools they need with ease.
3. Paragon
Paragon is one of the most in-depth tools when it comes to backup systems. Like other tools, it protects users from a hard drive malfunction and it does so efficiently. However, it takes things even further, specializing in protecting users from outliers such as viruses and other software issues that are highly random.
Paragon casts a wide net when it comes to catching issues that might lead to data loss. It even gives users different options and features when it comes to their recovery. Users are able to choose the files and folders they want to be backed up. Of course, they’re also able to backup everything if that’s necessary.
4.O&O DiskImage
O&O is one of the most versatile systems available, a clear positive for the users hoping to do a lot with their backup program. On top of the many different restoration tools, it also comes with some helpful things to get you started. It comes with a free trial so that users can see if it fits their needs. It’s also very easy to begin using, as the setup is noticeably easier than other systems.
There are a lot of features to point out with O&O, starting with its speed. Any unfortunate downtime is lessened by how quickly O&O gets you back on your feet. It also allows for backup while doing other tasks, which prevents an inefficient workday. There’s a powerful backup automation feature that caters to whichever files the user wants restored. This saves time during the initial setup process as well.
Remember, there’s more ways than you think for your valuable data and files to get lost. Unless you have the right backup system in place, it’s bound to affect you negatively."

November 24, 2019|
Branding creates lifelong customers and creates positive perspectives about a business. That is, only if the branding is effective. In order to truly understand branding, it takes research. Luckily, I’ve selected three of the best books on branding so you can get on the right track instantly.
Why is branding so important?
Branding is so valuable because it creates enduring impacts on customers and clients, giving them insight into how your company behaves. It also shows them a glimpse of the future, creating positive expectations for future transactions.
Branding effects a lot of different areas, including customer service and advertising. Think of branding like a domino effect – a minimal branding effort sends a lot of different company departments spiraling. It ultimately creates legitimate trust with your customers, bolsters advertising and brings in new customers and clients.
Now that you know how important branding is to a company, it’s time to dig into some reading material that will guide you to master it. Here are the three best branding books available:
3 Must-read branding books
The following books are the best branding books available in my opinion. Though everyone has their own specific needs, these three choices should get everyone on the right path to success.
1. Aaker on Branding
No competent list of branding books would be complete without at least one selection from David Aaker, the creator of the Aaker Model. Though his collection of helpful brand books is immense and ranges from traditional branding all the way to branding in the time of social media, I felt the most important choice was Aaker on Branding.
Aaker on Branding is probably the book you should get first in your marketing journey. It contains all the basic principles of branding, divided into different sections so they’re easily identifiable. However, this isn’t to say that it is entirely basic. In fact, it’s made up of in-depth ideas and strategies to conquer your goals and create powerful companies. Definitely check this one out first.
2. Kellogg on Branding
Kellogg on Branding is one of the very first books I read on the subject, and it remains just as important to my understanding of branding today as it did then. What makes it so valuable is the exhaustive range of topics it covers, from the basics to strategies.
One of the most unique things you’ll take away from this book is the different ideas about how companies excel in different ways. You’ll be surprised that success is dynamic and never so cut and dry. Further, this book will guide you to take these principles and apply them to your own branding efforts. You’ll have new, inspiring ways to handle your brand strategies.
3. Brand Thinking and Other Noble Pursuits
Brand Thinking and Other Noble Pursuits, by Debbie Millman, is a lot different than the other branding books available. So different, in fact, that it seemed obligatory that I included it in this list. Too often authors follow the same structure when relaying their branding knowledge to us. Though they certainly have valuable information we should absorb, after a while it all runs together with other books as just another branding guide.
What makes Brand Thinking and Other Noble Pursuits is it is an entire book that is comprised of interviews with numerous different brand experts. It delivers intimate insight into the lives and thoughts of revolutionary branding figures and gives us their thoughts on the topic. This book promises to spark new interest in branding as well as provide us with different perspectives to follow.
In the end, not everyone is going to learn as much about what they truly need from one book compared to another. However, be open-minded in your learning. If a book is failing to connect with you, try to determine why. The reason might lead you to find even more success elsewhere."

9. Duct Tape Marketing
What type of content you can expect from this blog: Duct Tape Marketing’s blog is geared towards helping small business branding efforts.

Why this blog will be relevant in 2021: No roadblocks seem large enough to slow down Sticky Branding from putting out new content. In fact, when it seems things are trending in a way that makes it hard for blogs to continue making posts, Sticky Branding seems to increase their efforts and get content released.

These examples will offer you a healthy selection of branding blogs to read in 2021. However, it’s possible that you get ‘blogged out’ and wish to try a different medium. Here are a few alternatives to blogs that you can try.
Alternatives to branding blogs
There is a lot of good information available on branding blogs, particularly the ones I’ve listed above. Of course, we all consume information differently, and reading a blog might not be the best way for you personally to learn. When that’s the case, look for some alternate ways to find branding information. I’ll discuss two notable methods here.
Branding podcasts
The first alternate to reading branding blogs is to listen to branding podcasts. Many blogs also release content in podcast form. If audio is your preferred method of learning, podcasts are the way to go.
Don’t forget to check out my list of the best branding podcasts as well.
Advantages of podcasts over traditional branding blogs
The first thing to consider with podcasts is the convenience factor. In many ways, a podcast can be more convenient than a written blog because it allows the audience to consume it in a variety of different ways, including on the go. It’s not really possible to read a blog while driving a vehicle, after all.
Podcasts also offer audiences a chance to be entertained and learn in an entirely different way, which can often help the information stick in long term memory more effectively. That’s not to say a traditional blog can’t entertain, but podcasts offer a different experience.
Finally, the biggest advantage to consider is that some of the best branding minds might not have a traditional blog, and the only way to consume their content is in podcast form.
Podcast disadvantages
With a podcast, listeners can’t explore the new content as quickly or conveniently as they could if they were reading a traditional blog. For example, let’s say the podcast host briefly describes a new topic to help make a point about their main topic. In a blog, there might be a hyperlink you could immediately click to get more information about this subtopic. If there wasn’t, you could search for the topic before continuing reading. There are no hyperlinks in podcasts.
Finally, podcasts are restricted by limitations of hardware and opportunity. It’s a lot easier for someone to put their ideas in words than it is to do so in a podcast, because podcasts require extensive equipment, especially if the sound quality is to be optimal.
Webinars and videos
The fact of the matter is that not everyone with something to teach us about branding has a blog. Because of this, it’s also worth seeking out recorded webinars and videos online important. Luckily, these are readily available on YouTube and other platforms which are either free or easy to access.
One popular way to consume video content about branding is to watch TED talks. This can be done directly on the TED website, or on their YouTube channel. The best thing about webinars and videos are they’re usually pretty accessible, as the brands behind them don’t try to restrict them from the public. Check them out if you want a different way to learn about branding.
Closing thoughts
Branding blogs are more important in 2021 than ever, since the landscape of the medium has grown in both quality and quantity. The fact that you’re able to read the words of some of the greatest minds in the industry for free is a blessing that you can’t afford to miss out on.
Take the time to visit the suggestions above and see which blogs pique your interest. Chances are, you’ll find useful information and insightful takes on whatever important branding moments arise in 2021. Good luck!

43,https://www.canto.com/blog/best-branding-podcasts/,"Secrets in audio form: The best branding podcasts of 2021
January 11, 2021|
Podcasts are one of the fastest growing ways to consume information, as they’re a simple format that don’t require focused attention.
As such, numerous branding programs have popped up and taken the format by storm. There’s a lot to be learned about branding, and a podcast is the perfect way to gather this important information.
Whether you’re someone who wants to learn more about branding or you simply enjoy podcasts, you’re bound to find something you like from the following list I’ve created.
Here are seven of the best branding podcasts on the market today, followed by some insight into creating your own, if you’re so inclined.
What it’s all about: The Message is a story-based, science fiction podcast from General Electric. Though this particular podcast doesn’t give branding insight directly (my other examples will, don’t worry), it gives it indirectly in the form of a unique example. The Message has found a way to promote their brand with subtlety that intrigues listeners each episode.
Who it’s for: The Message is for a wide-ranging audience, from sci-fi fans to podcast fiends to people interested in GE and new technology.
What makes it stand out: The Message manages to promote GE innovations without being intrusive to any alien-filled storylines in each episode. The premise of this idea might make some people believe this is just an extended advertisement, but the delivery will have them thinking otherwise when they listen to the episodes.
What it’s all about: Brand Builder is a podcast that allows a blend of diverse brands to share their unique branding stories. It especially gives voices to up and coming companies and startups to learn the struggles they face(d). Each new episode offers interesting perspectives that build a foundation for brand understanding.
Who it’s for: Brand Builder is specifically for anyone looking for modern insight into a diverse group of industries. It’s also for people who want fresh, diverse perspectives on all things branding.
What makes it stand out: Brand Builder stands out because of its guest, particularly, its wide range of different guests. Podcasts typically get stuck in the habit of staying within a small topic or category, especially when bringing on guests. This show instead reaches each corner of the branding world, giving valuable insight on every industry.
What it’s all about: .future is, as the name suggests, all about the future of our world. Each podcast episode, hosted by Cristina Quinn, guides listeners through hot tech topics that will influence the way we live. Each show is drastically different from one another, though there is an underlying theme throughout.
Who it’s for: This podcast probably appeals a bit more to people committed to and/or interested in Microsoft, but it also appeals to science fanatics and tech savvy folks.
What makes it stand out: .future is much more like an audio book than a podcast, in that it treats each show like a sequential episode in a series. There is currently only one ‘season’ of this podcast, though more may come in the future (pun intended).
What it’s all about: Marketing Over Coffee is a fast-paced, no-nonsense weekly show from marketing experts John J. Wall and Christopher S. Penn. It’s name is quite literal, as the episodes are recorded from a Massachusetts coffee shop. The topics range from social media to SEO, and each episode remains roughly in the 20-30 minute range.
Who it’s for: Anyone looking to get a laid back yet expert-level discussion into their ears each week concerning important marketing and branding techniques and tactics.
What makes it stand out: It’s probably pretty obvious, but the location is what gives this podcast its true differential from other shows. Recording in a public place presents a whole different type of recording and listening experience for all parties.
What it’s all about: As the title suggests, The Brand Authority Podcast helps you create brand authority, which enables strong brand differentiation and provides opportunities for success. Host Rebekah Radice puts listeners on the right track on many different strategies and tactics involving branding. With interesting topics and episodes slightly under an hour, the show is a must-hear.
Who it’s for: If you’re not getting the full effect of branding and seeing success, The Brand Authority Podcast is right up your alley. Each episode is very direct, filled with information and easy to follow and understand. Even beginners will follow along.
What makes it stand out: The Brand Authority Podcast is most noticeably a branding show that focuses on building authority through social media platforms. Though this doesn’t include every episode, this focus makes it unique to the community.
What it’s all about: The aptly named Logo Geek Podcast is a singularly-focused show that is dedicated to give designers a greater understanding of logos and their place in the branding world. Host Ian Paget fills the hour-plus episodes with a dynamic understanding of design, as well as interesting interviews with industry leaders.
Who it’s for: The Logo Geek Podcast gives designers a chance to understand more about the branding process, which should in turn give them a leg up when seeking to create fitting visuals for companies.
What makes it stand out: Despite the show being extremely focused on one topic, it does a good job of discussing this topic (design) from many different important angles – from strategy, to mindset to marketing.
What it’s all about: The I Love Marketing podcast is a comprehensive marketing show hosted by marketing thinkers Dean Jackson and Joe Polish. The topics extend past the basics and into the lesser-explored territory of marketing and branding.
Who it’s for: I Love Marketing is a fan-favorite because of the lighthearted demeanor of the hosts and unique tops. Entrepreneurs who are starting out in their branding and marketing endeavors are most likely to get the most out of this podcast.
What makes it stand out: The hosts have a certain energy about them that is hard to explain, but is definitely fascinating. Also, the fact that I Love Marketing is willing to cover such a wide range of topics makes it special in the branding podcast community.
Building your own unique branding podcast
“The medium of podcasting and the personal nature of it, the relationship you build with your listeners and the relationship they have with you—they could be just sitting there, chuckling and listening… there’s nothing like that.” – Marc Maron
If the above podcasts showed you anything about drawing attention to a brand, you might be interested in creating your own podcast for your own branding strategy.
The following tips are crucial for anyone looking to start their own show.
Do your research
One of the best ways to research podcasts in order to create yours is to be an avid consumer of successful shows. Branch out your listening to find shows of all genres so that your learning will be free of limitations.
Even if you’re an expert-level marketer or have good knowledge of branding, if you’re unfamiliar with the podcast format, it will hold you back. Consider the ways other shows speak to their users and make a show that incorporates these ideas but in your own way.
This requires a different level of listening to popular podcasts, meaning you must think of all the ways the show is successful and where you could borrow from their ideas or improve upon them.
Equipment matters
This is the most overlooked portion of podcasts, especially for marketers and anyone speaking about branding. This can be a roadblock to success, which sounds unfair or even frustrating, but it is a reality of audience expectation today.
It’s easy to assume that if our expertise and authority is strong enough, the equipment we use to record our show won’t matter. We do want to go ahead with a podcast show regardless, but that doesn’t mean we can neglect this important aspect of podcasts.
Unfortunately, even the best guests, topics and content won’t save your podcast from irrelevance if the equipment you use to record it doesn’t measure up. It’s a standard to fulfill the bare minimum requirements of hardware in favor of the audience.
This doesn’t mean you have to go crazy with purchases and research into hardware, but make sure you have a decent group of tools that produce a good sound and allow for efficient editing.
Topic is key
You’ll need to consider what exactly you have to offer to the listeners, then combine that with what you think the audience wants. Otherwise, your expertise will go to waste. Being on-topic is important, but also giving new ideas alongside creative storytelling and other podcast tricks is helpful as well.
For example, if I’m an expert photographer and I make a show about how to take digital photos, the podcast will fail if my audience wanted to hear about how to take physical pictures.
Do extensive research to determine what types of topics to address based on your expertise, then measure this up with what the market is looking for.
It helps to build an outline of what you want to talk about in the episodes and compare it to the audience preference.
Final thoughts
It’s safe to say that branding secrets are scattered throughout different podcasts. Podcast creators seem more willing to tell all when filling hours of audio slots.
Use this to your advantage and find everything necessary to boost your branding process.

44,https://www.canto.com/blog/best-brands-of-the-world/,"Best brands of the world: An examination (with examples)
November 25, 2020|
The first thing brands do when they come into creation is stack themselves up against their peers. In order to figure out if they’re successful or elite, they use competing brands as a measuring stick.
This article will serve as a guide to show you the types of things the best brands of the world are doing, and how you can use that information to increase your own brand’s success.
How does a brand become one of the best of the world?
“You can’t build a reputation on what you are going to do.” – Henry Ford
If someone were so inclined, they could create a checklist of all the things the best brands of the world would need to qualify. That level of extensiveness is unnecessary in this case, but there are some common traits worth mentioning.
One important aspect is value and revenue. These are two of the strongest indicators of whether or not a brand is great. Brands in the tech industry have a higher chance of making the list, since their chances of revenue and value growth are currently very high.
That means brands can’t always influence whether they become one of the best brands of the world. Sometimes it’s just about being in the right industry. However, certain things like adherence to brand values, structuring of goals, creative marketing campaigns and more give your brand a serious shot at success.
Remember, even though I offered some things that help brands stand out, there’s really no guarantee that doing certain tasks correctly will boost your brand to the top level. However, following best practices for branding will certainly boost your brand at least some , even if only a bit.
To further these points, let’s take a look at some examples of brands that do things right.
9 examples of the best brands of the world
The following nine examples will give you an idea of what the best brands are and how they’ve grown to such heights. These are certainly not the only fantastic brands out there, but they act as a good example for brands to learn from.
I chose these nine brands based on certain criteria, including the concepts I mentioned above. The following brands are thriving financially and are highly-recognizable compared to their industry peers.
1. Apple
Apple is a brand that creates computers, smartphones and other electronics, while also selling different technological services. It is a highly popular brand that is noted for their effective ad campaigns and simple, one-size-fits all products that cater to the technologically savvy as well as the beginner.
Why it’s considered one of the best brands of the world: Apple has immense brand value and continues to see financial growth. Being in the tech industry, as I pointed out earlier, is also an advantage. The tech industry is booming and has been for some time, so certain brands are reaping the rewards.
Apple has always been able to take existing products or ideas and develop something more accessible to the general public. Finally, Apple’s commitment to marketing and creativity has elevated them above competitors, keeping their brand image strong for years.
2. Google
Google is a tech company that provides internet services such as advertising and software. It is most known for its search engine, which continues to be more effective and popular than any other engine by far. Lesser-known Google products include different tech products, including hardware and hardware-related services.
Why it’s considered one of the best brands of the world: Google has shined almost since its inception, growing its value considerably for years. It is in the tech industry at the right time, making it valuable as well.
Google’s brand recognition is massive, and has joined the ‘club’ of brands who replace the name given to a verb by most people. For example, we now say, “I’m going to Google that” instead of “I’m going to search for that”.
3. Amazon
Before internet shopping was popular, Amazon existed to sell books, offering a much wider selection than any local bookstore or library. Through the years, it started selling furniture, electronics, food/beverages and more. Shopping at Amazon has become much more convenient than going to a brick-and-mortar store, since they have their own delivery service and the checkout process is a breeze.
Why it’s considered one of the best brands of the world: Amazon has revolutionized shopping, and they’ve done so with a priority and focus on meeting customers’ need for convenience. The reason they’re so highly valued is they continue to grow, both in the types of goods they sell, but also in acquiring other brands and bringing their products and services onto the platform.
4. Microsoft
Microsoft is a tech brand that sells computer software and personal computers. They are most known for their Windows system, which is the default in most personal computers today. Another standout Microsoft product are their tools in the Suite package, such as Word and Excel.
Why it’s considered one of the best brands of the world: Microsoft has its hooks in the computer world. It’s hard to go to the store and purchase a computer without getting some type of Microsoft system or software package.
5. Facebook
Facebook is a social media brand that changed the way people interact drastically. The Facebook website gives friends and former acquaintances a chance to connect and share ideas with ease. Facebook has grown its brand through the creation of helpful tools such as Messenger, and through the acquisition of other popular social media platforms such as Instagram.
Why it’s considered one of the best brands of the world: Facebook created a product and then expanded it, allowing users to connect from anywhere, with different devices. For Facebook, the business model of their service and its convenience has helped them thrive, even throughout controversies. The idea of switching to a different social media platform is more inconvenient than it sounds, and it’s unlikely you would find a realistic alternative.
6. Disney
Disney is an entertainment business that specializes in creating content for television, while also building successful theme parks and resorts. The Disney television network is ever-expanding, as they’ve added things like ESPN and the Disney streaming platform to their lineup. Disney is an iconic brand that seems to always be at the top of whatever market they enter.
Why it’s considered one of the best brands of the world: Disney is one of the most recognizable brands, and there is a level of quality people expect from the brand. For example, when people are looking for a movie that their kids will enjoy, settling on a Disney film is usually their best option. It has continued to grow in value, as it expands by acquiring different media brands.
7. McDonald’s
McDonald’s is a restaurant franchise that has global locations and an extremely recognizable likeness. It continues to grow and thrive due to its ability to offer convenient services and products and adapting to the changing landscape of diet and nutrition from culture to culture.
Why it’s considered one of the best brands of the world: McDonald’s, unlike other food franchises, has grown itself into something bigger by catering to more markets and expanding to as many places as possible. Their marketing is unique and effective, and they have prioritized kids in their campaigns to make it easier for a family to choose their brand over others.
8. Coca Cola
The Coca-Cola brand is responsible for the product Coca-Cola, which is a flavored soft drink that is extremely popular around the world. It has gotten deals with all types of companies and industries for its products to be sold exclusively inside them (including McDonald’s). They have a very memorable font and color scheme and their marketing draws on holiday cheer to sell more products.
Why it’s considered one of the best brands of the world: Coca-Cola has been able to compete with all comers in the soft drink industry, as it is willing to adapt to changing markets. We see this in the alternate flavors they offer, like cherry and vanilla coke, as well as their continued expansion into different types of drinks, such as sports drinks and energy drinks.
9. Tesla
Tesla is an innovative brand that sells electric vehicles that are unique and changing the way roads function. They also sell solar products. Tesla is always making headlines, as it is committed to being first in the frontier for electric vehicles, as well as other new ideas for automobiles.
Why it’s considered one of the best brands of the world: Tesla ran with an idea to change the way people drive, and they’ve not only been successful at it, they’ve completely revolutionized the way people think of the future of automobiles. The name Tesla is iconic, not just in the way it is linked to cars, but in the way it is linked to the future.
Applying these principles to your own brand
Now that you’re aware of some of the best brands and why they’re thriving, let’s dive into how you can take what they’re doing and emulate it.
You probably noticed some common denominators in the examples above: most of them are in the tech and food and beverage industries. It’s just a reality that brands in some industries are in a better position to succeed. Don’t despair if you’re not in those same industries. Instead, use the lessons from what the great brands in those industries do well to improve your own brand.
Know that someday an industry may overtake another, so stay on the lookout for common principles that have accelerated these movements in the past. For example, Amazon was once inferior to physical retail brands, but their innovative shopping methods eventually overcame this inferiority. Seek out ways to differentiate in your own industry as well.
Another criteria in the evaluation of best brands is their revenue. Of course, you can’t directly control revenue and brand value, but there are of course things you can do to influence it.
Research how brands succeed through different customer interactions and marketing campaigns. Then see how this stands out next to their competitors. This type of analysis gives you a chance to succeed.
The future of your brand
At the end of the day, focus your efforts on keeping your brand relevant in its market. The beautiful thing about successful brands is that it’s easy to see what they’re doing right.
Stay on the lookout for emerging trends, and remain diligent with your awareness of the best brands of the world.

45,https://www.canto.com/blog/best-cloud-storage/,"3 transformative ideas to redefine your search for cloud storage systems
December 4, 2019|
It’s scary to think companies and consumers upload sensitive files to cloud storage systems without radical evaluation of the different options available. Popular cloud storage searches are limited to things like price, performance and security – all important details – but they’re failing to even scratch the surface of your TRUE needs. Here are three dynamic tips to help revamp your entire search process for the best cloud storage system available.
1. Storage is important but retrieval is infinitely more valuable
We’ve let the name ‘cloud storage’ fool us into thinking its most important aspect is the storage. Not even close. The retrieval is way more important! In fact, you should begin your search with the words ‘cloud retrieval’ at the front of your conscious.
If we made a deposit into the bank and it took them a while to store our money, it would be frustrating. However, a slow retrieval would be way worse. Imagine waiting hours for the bank to get your money out to you. The same applies with your sensitive cloud-stored files. Make sure they can get it to you fast. And make sure you can find it easily because it’s organized effectively.
One crucial element to the retrieval process is metadata, a type of data that describes other data. Finding a system that effectively utilizes metadata goes hand-in-hand with efficient retrieval of stored files. Metadata assigns keywords stored files, allowing users to search specific files for instant recall.
2. Seek security from lesser-known threats
The innocuous threats to your stored files are the biggest danger. Most cloud storage systems offer security measurements against outside intruders, such as hackers. This is certainly valuable but it shows a lack of outside-the-box thinking by cloud storage companies. Here are two lesser-known threats that should be addressed in your cloud storage search:
Users within your own company
The cloud storage system you choose should boost security with your own company users. Administrators have classified files and sometimes the most dangerous intrusions are from their own employees. Ensure your next system effectively restricts employee usage based on your preferred settings.
Security from the storage company themselves
The threat companies fail to prepare against is the storage company themselves. Companies can be trusted and backed by reviews but company integrity isn’t the issue. Without measures against their own employees, the cloud company puts your sensitive files at risk. They should be private, even to the hosting company. Make sure end-to-end encryption is a part of their features to prevent this.
3. Rankings are for the masses. You have different needs.
Most articles written about best cloud storage rank top systems based on some kind of algorithm that measures security, price and popularity. If you put your faith into these vanilla, generalized rankings you’ll buy the wrong system altogether. If you wanted to buy a truck specifically for driving in the snow, reading a “Top 5 Trucks” list would be useless, because it would rank things that you don’t personally value.
Instead, you want your searches to feed into your main concerns. Compile a list of the most important needs to your company, then refine all search parameters around it. Ignore what works best for others and instead focus on what will work best for you.
Some example cloud storage systems
After you take in the three tips above, it’s time to put them to good use. When selecting a cloud storage system, be aware of which systems will truly meet your personal needs. Examine whichever system you might select using the above metrics in order to obtain the best results.
Some common cloud systems include Dropbox, Box, Microsoft OneDrive and Sync. Though these all have their merits, they don’t all meet the needs of the modern user the way a digital asset management (DAM) does. In fact, DAM is the only one that implements metadata tools, provides fast retrievability and offers end-to-end encryption. Though some of the other cloud systems do this, they don’t do everything else the right way.
Ultimately, you need a cloud storage system designed uniquely to help you. Put in the time and effort to determine whether your next system has everything you need to succeed."

April 16, 2020|
Team members are sharing, storing and downloading digital photos all the time, which means storage space is shrinking. Advances in technology have allowed digital images to retain immense resolution. This makes photos larger in file size.
Because of this, it’s important to implement a photo organizing software system. However, all photo organizers are not created equal. What works well for someone storing family albums won’t cut it for large enterprises. Modern businesses need photo software that goes beyond traditional organization.
Fortunately, there are a lot of different photo organizing software programs to choose from, many of which are designed for companies in need of advanced storage.
Below are 7 of the most unique photo organization tools available, as well as key details that help you navigate each system to determine if it’s compatible with your company.
1. Zoner Photo Studio
Zoner Photo Studio is, above all else, a simple system to use. This benefits anyone who struggles with technical issues during projects. Zoner’s features and tools are labeled and easy to find, even for the least tech savvy users. Although Zoner is simplistic, it remains a strong photo organizing software because of its many features and tools. It especially helps in labeling and keywording images, an important task for all photo-heavy projects and campaigns.
Another powerful benefit is its update and upgrade consistency. Each year Zoner adds different features, tools and upgrades to existing systems. These constant updates and changes keep it current as technology changes. This is an important aspect for digital image tools in our current climate, where all different types of improvements alter the way our photos exist.
Though Zoner is great for users working with their private photos, it doesn’t meet the needs of a company. Another place it falters is its lack of complex photo organizing potential. It unfortunately doesn’t have the necessary tools for advanced team members looking to store images. Though its simplicity may help certain companies with basic photo storage, many will find fault in its limitations.
2. Canto DAM
Canto digital asset management (DAM) is a comprehensive photo organizing software with advanced enterprise features. If you’re in need of photo software tools designed specifically for companies, DAM is the right choice for you. It offers breakthrough security features to protect sensitive image files from unauthorized use. DAM even automatically applies watermarks to stored and uploaded images.
A big reason DAM is so useful to companies is its metadata management tools, allowing users to locate stored images based on photo keywords. For example, if thousands of Atlantic Ocean pictures were stored in the DAM database, your teams could search ‘ocean’ to locate them. The metadata searches can be broad or specific, depending on the needs of your project.
Canto digital asset management also uses automatic tagging and facial recognition technology to make it easier to locate images in the system. And as a bonus, Canto integrates directly with Adobe Lightroom Classic. Ultimately, DAM is the most comprehensive photo organizing software for enterprises. Consider DAM when you need a system designed to save teams important time and increase workflows.
3. digiKam
digiKam is designed for anyone in need of advanced-level photo organizing software. This typically includes technical users who have programming and editing experience. The first standout feature of digiKam is it’s completely free. This is great for users on a budget who need an advanced system. Another plus is digiKam doesn’t mandate a lot of upgrades or updates. This saves a lot of time and hassle.
digiKam is open source software, which empowers users to navigate within the system. With digiKam, users finish image-based projects quickly. Furthermore, changing a photos’ organizational structure is possible without outside support. Even though digiKam has a lot of amazing features, it’s not for everyone. Make sure it’s within the range of your technical capabilities before using it.
4. Magix Photo Manager
Magix Photo Manager is ideal for users in need of basic image organizing software as part of a comprehensive video, music and media package. It’s a great solution that fulfills different storage needs and minimizes support requests. It organizes photos quickly using image library software and allows importing from popular cloud storage services. This ensures users are able to take pictures from their currently-used cloud systems.
Even though Magix Photo Manager is basic compared to other systems, there are some favorable qualities that make it the right choice for some users. First, it’s very fast and accurately handles fundamental organization tasks. It also automatically seeks and points out error-ridden photos with problems such as blurred graphics. These features keep the system competitive with more advanced organizing systems.
5. Google Photos
Google Photos is a free image service that offers users unlimited cloud drive space for pictures. This entire process is completed on Google’s familiar website. It also lets users search for specific features such as items within a photograph. Google Photos has a built-in editing tool, enhancing editing possibilities without the need for third-party software. These features make it a simple, effective program.
Google’s compression system makes it easy to store and share images. If an image is too large, sharing it is slow – especially with large quantities of recipients. Compression also keeps images manageable, speeding up the different processes. This saves drive space, which is a big reason why Google Photos is able to stay free. The only thing it isn’t good at is tackling complex photo storage tasks, typically needed by large enterprises.
6. Faststone Image Viewer
Faststone is a reliable photo organizing software with enough features and capabilities to work with most major image file types. It’s great for photographers and users with complex graphic design needs. One feature to consider is the way Faststone allows users to view stored photos in great detail. It provides superior picture vision, which saves time and avoids any hassles opening and closing files while searching.
Faststone allows users to import images from cameras directly onto the software. It supports the image file extensions from most major cameras – a huge plus for photographers. Many popular camera brands have their own flagship photo software, which limits FastStone usefulness. However, it’s the key software to consider for cameras without their own personal software system.
7. SmugMug
SmugMug is an online photo storage system designed for professional and aspiring photographers. It offers unique photography features inspired by industry professionals. SmugMug provides a secure system to store images and presents portfolios in a business-professional manner. The SmugMug layout is representative of how a physical art gallery or show might take place.
SmugMug helps photographers create websites, presentations and logos within a simple interface. Its attention to detail is crucial for photographers. Use SmugMug if you need to store and manage high resolution images. Even though this tool has a limited purpose, it’s perfect if you’re an aspiring or professional photographer.
Put your new photo tool to work
There’s no shortage of different photo organizing software systems to choose from. Keep in mind that each tool has unique complexities and features that aren’t for everyone.
Consider your specific digital image requirements, for now and the foreseeable future. This should guide you to select the right program for your company.
Begin your path to success today. We’re certain whichever program you select will boost your business!

48,https://www.canto.com/blog/best-podcasts-for-business/,"The 3 absolute best modern podcasts for business
April 21, 2020|
Listening to a quality business podcast brings you one step closer to success. It increases your business-literacy and forces you to think about topics differently. You wouldn’t expect to know a lot about business if you had never read a book about business. Similarly, you’d have to conclude that listening to business podcasts could only build upon your knowledge.
Ultimately, business podcasts deliver ideas from highly successful entrepreneurs who are willing to share what worked for them with their audience. It may seem counter-intuitive to trust that they’re so willing to give away their secrets. However, they aren’t giving it away for free. They’re promoting their company further and establishing themselves as an authority in a particular topic.
3 podcasts for business you can’t miss
Below are three shows that you need to check out if you’re looking for unique, modern perspectives and ideas from business professionals.
1. Mixergy
What: Interviews with business experts; topical discussions; numerous different episodes and guests.
How: Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, Mixergy.com
Who: Andrew Warner (plus other guests and hosts)
‘Mixergy’ delivers a wide variety of podcast episodes, ranging from current issues businesses face, to success stories that we can all learn from. The thing that stands out most about ‘Mixergy’ are its extensive guest appearances, professional hosts and basic show structure. It truly sticks to the script, so to speak, and keeps audiences engaged and informed on each new show topic. On top of interesting guests, ‘Mixery’ also provides plenty of unique topics that aren’t often tackled.
One thing that makes ‘Mixergy’ so great is its ability to deliver honest information to listeners in an exciting, structured way. Whereas other podcasts might only show audiences success stories, ‘Mixergy’ ensures they cover times where businesses and different models fail. This gives the audience reassurance that the show won’t mislead them or offer them guests who might misinform them.
2. Online Marketing Made Easy
What: Strategy for online companies; how-to guides for startups; extensive tips and tricks in each show.
How: Apple Podcasts, Amyporterfield.com
Who: Amy Porterfield (and guests)
‘Online Marketing Made Easy’ is focused entirely towards helping online businesses succeed. Each episode dives into important issues and navigates common problems online business owners often face. Though there are a few guests every so often, this podcast has much fewer guests than other shows. Instead, it’s focused on creating helpful ideas for interesting new issues.
The most important part of ‘Online Marketing Made Easy’ is its absolute commitment to staying within a single topic while filling each show with new and exciting information to learn. Though it doesn’t cover as many business issues that a more broader podcast might, it makes up for it by magnifying areas in a way that helps companies make minor, effective adjustments. Here are a few more suggestions for marketing podcasts to check out.
3. RISE Podcast
What: Dynamic, modern business tactics; interviews with cutting-edge business leaders; unique insight into author Rachel Hollis’ creative business ideas.
How: Apple Podcasts, thehollisco.com
Who: Rachel Hollis (and guests)
‘RISE Podcast’ presents listeners with ideas that demand effort and involvement, rather than simply a passive listening experience. Each show offers groundbreaking insight into common business topics, then has audiences try things in order to make sure they’re taking everything they can in from the episode.
What makes ‘RISE’ stand out is the unorthodox guest lineups. It seems like a business podcast should have business-related guests on the show, (which does make a lot of sense) but ‘RISE’ uses experts from other areas to gather new insight and perspective in order to relate it to business. This keeps listeners on their toes and excited to learn more each episode.
Not everyone has the same routine or strategy for listening to podcasts. Some may listen in the car, others while relaxing in a chair at home. However the place, time, or device, make sure that you’re at least listening to the best podcasts for business."
49,https://www.canto.com/blog/best-practices-metadata/,"Best practices for metadata
April 23, 2021|
Metadata is a set of data that provides detail about another piece of data, all recorded directly within the software. Using metadata will keep your media library in line and vastly improve the speed at which you search for your assets.
Let’s learn about how metadata can be best incorporated into your team’s workflow so that you can begin organizing assets.
Keywords and tags
Metadata is comprised of a naming structure called taxonomy, and under the taxonomy umbrella is a system of keywords and tags. How taxonomy is designed will be different for each company, but it should still follow conventions that will feel natural to your team.
Keywords
Keywords are the high level labeling convention. In other words, the type of keywords you should be assigning to your files will generally be more broad and inclusive to touch as many relevant fields as possible. Only Canto administrators can create new keywords in the backend, but contributors are able to add keywords to files.
When creating keywords, keep in mind these best practices:
1) When assigning keywords, covering the 5 W’s – who, what, when, where, why – will make for a well-rounded and well captured asset.
2) Look out for grammatical inconsistencies like tenses (ending in -ed), plural nouns (regular nouns ending in –s/– es and irregular nouns like ‘feet’), gerunds (ending in -ing), and misspellings.
3) Applying homonyms as keywords, or words that have the same sound but different meanings, may yield incorrect searches. For example, the word’ bat’ has multiple meanings and may bring ambiguity to your search.
4) Acronyms and abbreviations should stay consistent. For example, assigning an asset with a keyword ‘CA’ and another asset with ‘California’ will lead to confusion.
5) Being too narrow in your keyword will make it tough for users to recognize. Instead of ‘Dunsmuir, CA,’ expanding the range to ‘Northern California’ will be better for your team.
6) Being too broad in your keyword may capture too much, if not every asset in your media library. For example, ‘University’ may be too inclusive if everything in your library is related to it. Instead, you can use a more pointed keyword, like ‘School of Humanities.’
7) Keep keywords simple at just the most essential information will create an intuitive, if not obvious search structure. For users, a direct and distinct reference point will make searching for assets more accessible.
8) Beyond just metadata, Canto allows you to add other details to supplement information associated with the file. Relying on fields for objective data like name, date, size, and description can help ease the search for assets.
Tags
Tags are the low-level labeling convention. Any DAM system administrator or contributor can create tags and add them to files. Think of tags as a way of “supporting” keywords – they add focus to the asset that the very broad keywords cannot, so it’s useful to pair them together. Tags offer precision and character to supplement the wider scope that keywords usually encompass.
Canto also boasts a function called ‘Smart Tags.’ Powered by AWS Rekognition, relevant tags are automatically populated based on details detected in an image. The Smart Tag ‘Confidence Score,’ or the probability that a predicted detection is correct, can be toggled in Canto’s settings.
You can freely type in your desired tag and a corresponding tag will generate, but if you would like for the suggestions to withdraw (autofill), you can simply hit the ‘esc’ key.
For adding a large number of keywords or tags to files, Canto has the option to bulk add metadata as well.
For example:
Keyword type: Location
Tags: names of landmarks (“state park”, “monument”), names of buildings (“state capitol”, “Coit Tower”), names of environments (“rainforest”, “arctic”)
Keyword type: Template
Tags: titles of blank documents (“employee contract”, “NDA”), Adobe CC designs (“infographic”, “flyer”, “poster”)
Keyword type: Themes
Tags: names of travel destinations (“Beijing”, “Switzerland”), names of seasons (“Summer”, “Christmas”), lifestyle descriptors (“healthy”, “green”, “surf culture”)
Custom fields
For organizations looking to add specificity and a personal touch to their image library, custom fields can supplement information catered your team’s needs. Different industries will have different naming conventions, and you can customize these field types:
- Text: free form field for text
- Number: free form field for numbers
- Date: date options (choose from a calendar)
- URL: valid website address
Custom fields can be established in the backend and is only searchable in Advanced Search.
Folder-album structure
As a complement to metadata management, having an organized folder-album structure will even further streamline the search process. Implementing an elevated folder-album strategy can help you move away from the archaic nested folders of libraries past. Located all in a local server, folders would just keep cascading one onto the next, needing several clicks deep into the nested folder before finding what you need.
With a mindfully executed folder-album strategy, however, you can avoid having an enormous tree of folders. When building a folder-album structure, what are best practices?
1) House your folders by groupings. By category (such as food, sports, department), by date (quarter, year, month), by state of completion (draft, final, archive) are all useful in bracketing dense sets of data into smaller bits to be organized.
2) There is a hierarchy to your folders and albums. Folders can contain albums and other folders. Albums can only contain files. Importantly, a folder cannot hold files; it must contain an album that holds the files.
3) Folders should be kept lean and lightweight by limiting the amount of albums that exist within it. Keeping a folder at less than 20 – 30 albums will make it more manageable.
4) For Folders that do exceed the 20 – 30 album threshold, using Keywords instead may be a better option. For assets in this quantity, keywords, along with additional search parameters and filters will help to narrow down the results returned.
5) Do not name your folders and albums the same as your Keywords. Doubling down on the same nomenclature will not result in consistency. Rather, your searches may become too overpopulated.
Metadata will transform the way you organize your assets and liberate your media library. If you’re excited about the way metadata can help to solve your team’s needs, give Canto a try today."
50,https://www.canto.com/blog/bicycle-brand-became-retailers-source-for-images/,"How DAM helped a bicycle brand become retailers’ go-to source for cycling images
October 29, 2021|
Consumer cycling brands rely on local bike shops to highlight their products in marketing materials. Of course, so do their competitors. So how can brands stand out from the crowd and ensure their products are the ones that end up in the spotlight?
For Giant Bicycles UK, the answer is Canto. The team uses Canto to manage photos, videos and technical PDFs for the bikes and gear they sell. To become the easiest place for bike shop owners to get product images, they make key content from their library available externally in a sharing portal. Then, they use Canto reporting to refine their content strategy, providing more visuals retailers will actually want to use.
Step 1: Provide retailers with the easiest place to get product images and videos
Bike shop owners are busy. They don’t have time to chase down content or sift through disorganized folders. With their Canto Portal, Giant UK created a one-stop-shop for retailers’ cycling image needs.
“A lot of these retailers are dealing with three, four, maybe five brands,” explains Giant UK’s digital content strategist, Ricki Cumberland. “If we provide retailers with the easiest place to get graphics or whatever they need for their shops, they will hopefully come to us rather than a competitor brand.”
Now, when bike shops need an image for their website or storefront, they have Giant branded content right at their fingertips.
Step 2: See what retailers are actually using
Canto’s digital asset reporting provides detailed insights on download rates, top search terms and more. For the Giant UK marketing team, that means a bird’s-eye view of how hundreds of bike shops interact with their content. They can see what’s popular and what’s falling flat at a glance.
“We supply social assets to retailers. Before Canto, we would just send it out and hope that they would use it,” says Ricki. “Now we can actually see the download rates on them.”
Step 3: Let real-world data lead the way
Now that Giant UK knows what types of content retailers use most – and what gaps need to be filled – they can focus their efforts on content they know bike shop owners will want to use. If certain types of content languishes unused, Ricki knows something’s not working. When an image or video proves popular, the Giant team knows they’re on the right track.
Canto’s reporting data also helped the Giant UK team identify gaps in their visual content. One of the most popular search terms was for Liv, the company’s women-specific bike brand. Now they know to stock their retailer portal with more visual assets featuring Liv bikes. “It was an overwhelming demand we didn’t know was there,” says Ricki. “The data indicates where the trend is moving, and what the retailers are really liking.”
Brands invest a lot in content creation – around a third of their marketing budgets on average. So it’s well worth making the effort to ensure that investment pays off. By distributing content with Canto, Giant UK made it easy for retailers to feature their products. And as they monitor demand and real-life usage, they can easily adapt their content strategy to meet local bike shops’ changing needs.

51,https://www.canto.com/blog/binary-large-object/,"Binary large object: How to store large data
February 10, 2021|
A binary large object (BLOB) is a collection of concentrated data that’s stored on a file in a database or on a specific program. Although the name itself can sound complex, it relates to compressed binary data. Here we look to define what BLOB means in the data space, and how it’s managed by businesses.
What is a binary large object?
A BLOB is a raw file that can have a digital storage unit that is several gigabytes in size. It’s compressed into a single file that is then stored inside a database. Because binary data is only able to be read by a computer and is made up of numbers 0 and 1, it often requires a related program to be opened. Adobe and Microsoft are two popular examples. Because the raw content of a BLOB file is often unstructured when stored, it needs a name or type for a database to process the file and make it accessible.
Typical BLOB files and types:
- Video .avi
- Audio .mp3
- Images .jpeg
- Graphics .giff
Managing binary large objects
The challenge many businesses face is managing binary large objects. Often a database has an inability to read all BLOB files due to their binary nature. Again this is because databases are not able to clearly identify such large volumes of information. An option when choosing a storage solution for a BLOB is digital asset management (DAM). This removes the need for extra servers and helps improve efficiency through centralized cloud storage.
How you retrieve and share large binary files matters. If you don’t have databases equipped to handle unstructured data, information can be lost. Productivity can also slow as your team struggles to access files or make sense of what is on them. Choose a storage solution that can not only accommodate a BLOB but also makes sure files are able to be located and understood by your chosen system."
52,https://www.canto.com/blog/box-alternatives/,"3 unique Box alternatives to consider
March 25, 2020|
Box is a file storing service on the cloud that utilizes a simple interface and security features to help users organize digital files. Though Box has some really cool benefits, it also misses the mark in key places. Because of this, it’s important to check out some other file storage systems. Here are three Box alternatives that deliver unique, amazing results.
1. Canto digital asset management
Canto digital asset management (DAM) has made it easy for enterprise’s to move past Box and onto DAM systems. The biggest reason why companies transition to DAM from Box is because it integrates fully with Box. Another reason is it focuses on the things that are vital to businesses when it comes to file storage – security, organization, collaboration and brand maintenance – just to name a few. Where DAM really shines is its ability to simplify the entire file storage and sharing process, which in turns boosts creativity and saves precious time.
DAM is a system that answers the question plaguing enterprises: “Where are we going to store all this digital content?” It accomplishes this by adding crucial features and benefits that make its solution comprehensive. This includes things like quick file retrieval, metadata management and efficient file sharing. It also enhances team communication extensively, giving users a chance to remain in-touch during important projects and campaigns.
In what areas does DAM improve upon Box’s model? Here are some key differences:
- Extensive metadata features for better file organization and retrieval
- Comprehensive security and administrative control
- Benefits for enterprises, including vast scalability
- Automatic copyright and watermark functionality
Canto DAM has become a popular cloud choice for enterprise file storage. It continues to be a strong option due to its comprehensive tools and systems. Next, let’s take a look at the FileCloud system and see how it compares to Box.
2. FileCloud
FileCloud is a highly customizable, secure file sharing system. It is unique in that it offers file-sharing through SaaS, SaaP and a hybrid option. For companies with existing on-site servers that wish to sync to their file storage, FileCloud runs on those infrastructures. For businesses in need of cloud file storage, it has secure, dedicated cloud servers. Finally, the hybrid option (ServerSync) combines the on-site and cloud options. This proves FileCloud to be quite versatile.
When deciding whether a system fits your needs, it’s helpful to break down some of its key advantages and drawbacks. Here are some pros and cons of FileCloud:
Pros
- Assimilates with your current IT configuration
- Extensive administrator tools
- Secure remote access
Cons
- Restrictive for small businesses due to high user minimums
- Unpleasant complications can result from their sharing options
- Limited integrations
As you can see, FileCloud excels in a few key areas, though it fails to meet certain standards. This might be an issue, depending on the type of company seeking file storage. Last, we’ll review Dropbox, the most popular file storage tool available.
3. Dropbox
Dropbox is a versatile, popular cloud file storage system designed for individual users. Along with its similar-sounding name, it has quite a few system feature similarities to Box as well. Both systems won’t commit to focusing on individual use versus enterprise use. However, there are a few differences that make Dropbox stand out. One such difference is their willingness to improve on all their flaws and shortcomings. Dropbox at one time had many different issues that the company has since rectified. In fact, users can safely store files on Dropbox without worrying about massive holes in security. These upgrades keep Dropbox competitive.
Dropbox has some innovative features that attract a lot of users. One such feature is their ‘Papers’ option, which acts as a community space for ideas. In Papers, teams can collaborate in a singular location with multimedia files. Dropbox also provides constantly evolving security features that reassure users.
Dropbox has been one of the most popular file storage system for quite some time now so they’ve created a lot of positives for their software. However, they have some areas that they can’t seem to correct. Here are the main pros and cons of Dropbox:
Pros:
- Helpful integrations, including Microsoft Office products
- Valuable administration features
- Easy-to-use interface
Cons:
- Spreads itself too thin catering to both teams and individuals
- Large target for hackers due to popularity
- Limited file recovery and backup
Box isn’t for everyone, so make sure you have a detailed account of potential alternatives if it’s not for you. Chances are, even if you currently use Box, there’s a program that would better fit your needs."
53,https://www.canto.com/blog/box-dam/,"Ditch the “Box” – Store files digitally with the help of DAM technology
October 15, 2018|
The way companies store files has changed and continues to change. To stay competitive, you need to find a system capable of adapting to the continuous changes of digital file storage. You need to implement a system that manages digital assets efficiently. Box is a storage system that has basic functions, but it’s not a complete digital storage system. Businesses need more when storing sensitive digital files. Here are some key benefits to seek out when implementing a digital file storage system.
Workflow management is streamlined
It’s easy to find the perfect image or video file for a project when valuable company content is centrally stored in a complete digital file storage system. Consider solutions that not only provide a central location for digital assets but also automatically remove duplicates. This protects different users uploading the same file. A powerful constant in the organization of files is metadata, which is information about data.
Box offers functional metadata, but companies need to have advanced metadata operations to truly streamline workflow. This is where Canto’s digital asset management (DAM) thrives. Its advanced metadata system is one-of-a-kind, providing in-depth information about each asset. Use a system with sophisticated metadata functions to increase efficiency and organization.
Optimize and expand permission structures
It’s important that the system you choose makes it easy to access the correct content at the right time. Therefore it’s vital to implement software that allows a wide range of file permission configurations. Customizable portals, user roles, and both private and public portal access ensure administrators feel comfortable with how confidential content is shared.
DAM handles an extensive scope of permission configurations. Administrators have total control of sensitive data within a DAM system, and this boosts security as well as project efficiency. The DAM bends to the needs of the user, making it optimal for controlling access company-wide.
Use a system that promotes brand management
Advanced file storage solutions allow businesses to control how customers perceive them with features tailored to brand management. Few storage services have robust digital rights management features that allow team members to add watermarks and manage the copyright or terms and conditions of an asset. A storage system lets users create branded portals that showcase a brand’s identity. That way collaborators, outside teams and clients are always reminded of your brand.
Part of building and promoting brand is maintaining brand consistency. This is done by ensuring all team members within a company are working with the correct digital assets when creating brand images, logos and other brand indicators. DAM keeps everyone on the same page and makes sure brand is maintained throughout each campaign. It accomplishes this through management of brand images and layouts.
Canto’s digital asset management provides users with the above features and more. Consider a DAM when implementing a file storage system for your company."

Imagine decorating a building with strings of electric lights. The ‘wow’ moment comes at the end, when you plug them in, bringing all the colors to life.
Brand activation is like plugging your brand’s lights in and letting customers see the beautiful colors.
Follow this guide to see the different ways you can get creative with your brand activation.
What is brand activation?
Brand activation is a unique way to alert customers and potential customers to a brand through creative communication and experiences. Brand activation campaigns are meant to inspire customers to take action, spreading the word about a brand. Brand activation creates meaningful brand interactions for target markets.
Brand activation is a confluence of many different branding efforts, such as building awareness, brand image, communication and more. It’s typically a one-time event that gives meaning and purpose to a brand while connecting with customers.
Why brand activation matters
Most brands rank customer outreach, brand awareness and brand image at the top of their marketing priorities. Because brand activation is valuable because it touches on and builds all three. However, brand activation is its own category with specific benefits.
Think of brand activation as a way to jumpstart your brand, giving it a new perspective in the eyes of your target market. This can lead to developing a deeper, emotional connection with your customers, even if the method of activation seems minor.
On top of encouraging lifetime relationships with customers, brand activation also increases the chances of bringing new customers to your brand.
Now that you’re aware of how important brand activation is, let’s look at some different types of brand activation campaigns.
Different variations to consider
The following are unique ways to successfully go about brand activation.
Live events
It’s tough to beat a live event when it comes to brand activation. There’s plenty of truth to the fact that a live experience is more memorable. Most live events are planned, but they can be spontaneous as well.
For example, it might be beneficial to head to a trade show to show off your brand and introduce it to new customers. However, it might be just as interesting to try a less defined live setting, one that isn’t about brands, like a day in the public park.
The downside of live events is they’re limited in their outreach most of the time, and taking photos or videos of the event for social media doesn’t spread the word as well as you think.
Creative free sample handouts
For a lot of brands, the free sample is one of the easiest ways to promote a brand. This method is mostly associated with food, but free trials and other common marketing practices also fall into this category.
The key to making a free sample campaign work for your brand activation: you’ll need to go beyond the sample without being overbearing. Handing out a sample with no further efforts won’t get you far. Conversely, handing out free samples with too much effort will have negative consequences as well. Brands that do it right generally understand the balance required to not seem too desperate to make a sale.
Partnerships
Partnering up with another brand or popular figure is a unique and creative type of brand activation. Associating yourself with a brand people trust is a shortcut to getting them to trust your brand too.
For example, there was a recent chess tournament which included the world champion among other top players. The event was hosted by Airthings, a brand I hadn’t heard of until this event. They leveraged this chess tournament as a way to promote themselves indirectly, since people who would have never heard of the brand now feel connected to it since they hosted the tournament that interested them.
Trend-based campaigns
Following trends and using them to create a brand activation campaign is highly effective when done right. For example, if environmentally-friendly products are all the rage, you could promote your products’ contributions to sustainability efforts.
The potential downside to a trend-based campaign is when it flops, it flops hard. Audiences will quickly sniff out a ruse. If you’re not genuine about the trend, they won’t be interested in learning more about your brand.
Tips to make your campaign a success
Now that we’ve discussed different types of brand activation campaigns, let’s consider what you need to keep in mind to make your campaigns a success.
Be unpredictable
If your audience is able to predict what you’re going to do at an event or in a campaign, they won’t be all that impressed when you do it. If they’re expecting a free sample, make it a free sample with some cool experience attached. If they’re expecting a speech promoting your brand, make it a show promoting an ideal.
Too many brands rely on the same old methods to activate their brand, which doesn’t inspire customers. Think of brand activation as a success if and only if it does more than spread awareness about your brand. It should be a comprehensive success, creating numerous new possibilities.
Find ways to talk to (and listen to) your customers
One of the most underlooked aspects of brand activation is the power it has to inspire communication between brands and their customers. However, communication can come back to bite brands if not done right.
The key is to make the campaign a chance to hear your customers. The more that an event gives customers a chance to give meaningful thoughts and feedback on a certain issue, the higher they will regard a brand. Remember that this event is for them, not you.
Inexpensive; not cheap
Lastly, it’s important to aim your brand activation campaigns to be for everyone. When an event is free or requires little to enter or partake, it has a chance to pull more people in.
Don’t confuse inexpensive with cheap, though. A brand activation won’t be satisfying if it’s full of corner-cutting and low quality. Put forth the effort to get people truly excited.
Examples to help guide you
These brand activation campaigns combined great ideas and solid execution to successfully engage customers.
Nature Valley’s Be Great Out There
What began as an effort to offer samples to audiences in a creative way, turned into an effective, lengthy campaign for Nature Valley.
What they did: The ‘be great out there’ campaign began as a simple way to give out free samples of Nature Valley’s granola bars in an outdoor setting. The twist was that the audiences were able to design the packaging and take photos for social media with their designed food.
One way to activate a brand, as I discussed above, is to get free samples or a free trial to your customers. Taking advantage of this idea, Nature Valley found out that they could have their cake and eat it too, as they were then able to leverage their sampling success into an ongoing marketing campaign.
This creative way to give free samples was a game changer for Nature Valley, because they did it in a way that removed the sales aspect from it and focused more on the customer and their outdoor lifestyle.
How we can apply this to our brand activation attempts: This sets a good example of how to make a campaign laidback and fun while promoting core values, spreading the word of your brand and getting customers involved, all while giving them free samples. You don’t have to copy this blueprint exactly, but there are a lot of helpful things here to use for your own campaigns.
Blair Witch Project (Film)
This doesn’t fall under the typical category of brand activation, but it’s highly relevant and can lead the way to all types of new ideas.
What they did: In an attempt to promote an upcoming film, the makers of the ‘Blair Witch Project’ took an all-out marketing blitz approach, creating flyers, internet rumors and other fake lore to create a unique realness aura of their fake-documentary film. The result was evident in the ticket sales, as the film sold approximately $250 million worth worldwide, a number they surely wouldn’t have reached without their pre-release marketing efforts.
How we can apply this to our brand activation attempts: A new brand can make just as big a splash as an established one. Brand activation is the key to make it happen. Just be sure to put in the effort and think creatively.
Wendy’s Carter
Wendy’s is one of many brands who took to social media as a way to further connect with their customer base in a unique way.
What they did: When one of their fans, a boy named Carter, asked for free food for a year, Wendy’s set a goal, which Carter eventually reached. They made good on their deal, and the publicity of the event carried to other platforms.
How we can apply this to our brand activation attempts: Don’t restrict yourself to traditions. Take a chance on giveaways or new personas. There is often a new market waiting to be explored, and your brand could be the first in the door.
Closing thoughts
No matter what steps you’ve taken in the branding process, there’s a likely chance you need an extra little push. Your audience might be broader than you think. Create a brand activation campaign that pulls them in and let’s them connect in a meaningful way.
Make sure whatever you choose illuminates your brand and gives everyone a chance to see it clearly.

July 15, 2020|
Growing technology and social media options have increased the potential value of brand advocates.
The reality of today’s advocacy is there are limitless sources to promote a brand if someone is so inclined. Today, spreading the word means more than telling a few friends or family – it means telling the world.
What is a brand advocate?
A brand advocate promotes your brand without any external incentive to do so, often by word-of-mouth. They are usually a customer who had a great experience with a brand and felt the need to tell others about it. A brand advocate is valuable because they drive customers to your brand.
Marketers cite advocacy marketing as typically their most profitable and cost-friendly online marketing method.
3 distinct reasons why brand advocates are so important
We like to think of loyal customers as some of our most profitable customers, but upon further examination, it becomes clear that a brand advocate is much more valuable.
Let’s compare the two to get an example of why this is. First, consider a loyal customer. They will likely purchase our products and services every time they need something from our brand industry. This then continues over their lifetime.
Now, consider that a brand advocate will essentially do the same. They love our products so much that they buy them over the competition whenever possible.
On top of that, they will voice positive opinions about our brand and new products or services we release. This potentially leads to more sales and numerous new customers.
Even if the advocate never purchased from us (unlikely), they are still more valuable than a loyal customer.
Why is this? What makes a brand advocate so effective at promoting a brand? And how does modern technology apply? Here’s a further breakdown:
1. The power of social trust
Picture for a moment that you’re watching television and an advertisement comes on, in which a celebrity you know endorses a new e-reader. They might show themselves using it in a montage, give a few benefits it provides them and suggest reasons why you need it.
Now consider that you and a close friend are having lunch, and the topics of books comes up. They tell you that they’ve been able to read so much more lately because of how nice their e-reader is.
They explain the different benefits and how it has helped them overcome common reading obstacles.
You have some uncertainties about the screen that you ask about. They point out that their e-reader allows for bigger fonts to avoid eye strain.
In the above two scenarios, people are much more likely to buy the e-reader their friend uses. They trust their friend and value their recommendation over the celebrity. There’s a lot of different reasons for this.
The biggest reason is that they know and trust a friend. They value their opinion and believe they’re being truthful and not just trying to make a sale.
Also, their friend’s needs are likely to be similar to their own (since most people aren’t celebrities). Finally, they were able to ask and receive answers about the product on the spot.
Even though brand advocacy isn’t always the difference between a celebrity advertisement and a close friend endorsing a product, we still see the power that a brand advocate possesses.
If the advocate speaks out positively for our brand and products to total strangers, there’s still a good chance they are given a high level of trust. It’s a lot easier for people to trust their peers who have nothing to gain by convincing us that a brand is good or bad.
Now let’s consider how far the brand advocate’s messages can spread.
2. The outreach of contemporary advocacy
To truly understand the potential power of a brand advocate, we have to consider the modern realities of technology and social media.
Even the most well-connected brand advocates in the past were fairly limited. Sure, they were able to tell their friends, family and maybe a few coworkers about how great a brand is. And this was absolutely important.
However, it pales in comparison to the potential outreach of well-connected brand advocates today. Further than friends, family and coworkers, which modern advocates can still give recommendations to, there are now many different platforms to branch out to.
First, there’s social media, where users connect with hundreds and thousands of minor acquaintances. There’s also online review platforms, where an advocate could potentially, in great detail, recommend a brand or rate a product.
It’s not hard to see that brand advocates have some serious value – how much is the question.
3. The measurable value of brand advocates
A brand advocate, depending on their outreach, could be worth potentially much more than the average customer, especially long term.
It’s estimated that over 80% of customers prefer recommendations from someone they know over other sources. Combine this with the fact that a word-of-mouth recommendation is believed to be the driving force of over 40% of purchases, and you have quite a valuable commodity.
In today’s world of transparency, a brand advocate is one of the best weapons to have on your side. Websites that offer customer reviews and ratings are a constant reminder that it’s important to have someone praising your brand.
Another lesser-known way that brand advocates help is by creating content without any external incentive. Essentially, they are creating content which promotes your brand and you don’t even have to pay them for it.
This creation certainly helps limit the marketing budget from overspending on content creation, since their job is being done for them essentially.
Now that you have some reasons why a brand advocate is so valuable, let’s make sure you know how to attract new ones.
Dynamic methods to attract new brand advocates
It’s pretty clear how important brand advocates are, so how do we go about creating them? I’ve come up with some methods that are sure to do the trick.
Focus on brand experience
What better way to entice a customer to spread the good word about your brand than an experience they love and connect with?
Not only is a brand experience memorable and long lasting, but it gives customers a reason to tell others about your brand.
It’s not that hard to see why this would be the case, either. Think of how common it is for someone to relay a brand experience to someone they know.
Maybe the movie theater they took their kids to had characters from the movie in costume greeting the youngsters as they entered and exited the screening. Certainly they would tell others, especially those with kids themselves, of their good time at the film.
Think of ways your brand can create unique, memorable experiences for customers. Chances are these powerful experiences will form lifelong brand advocates.
Implement compelling brand storytelling
“Storytelling is the most powerful way to put ideas into the world today.” – Robert McKee
A google search can seem like a common thing nowadays. Users log on to the popular search engine to quickly find an answer to a question, new website, local restaurant and more. Chances are that there’s not much thought given into what they search after the fact.
However, because of the genius idea of Google to turn their yearly searches into a compelling storytelling campaign, users are now seeing searches as impactful, meaningful and important.
The idea is simple: Each year, Google compiles user searches and creates a YouTube video that turns the most popular ones into a fascinating tale. A theme typically emerges, and it helps users connect with the idea that their input builds history.
This type of storytelling helps brands connect with customers. It gives brands a chance to give valuable insight into what they stand for and who they really are. This can help them stand out to customers.
As we see each year after Google tells their story, there is a lot of intrigue, connection, hype and buzz surrounding a powerful brand story.
Think your brand might have its own story to tell?
Offer a quality and reliable product or service
There are a lot of different factors that help create brand advocates. One of them, probably the most important foundation, is how quality the product you provide is.
This seems pretty logical, since all the experiences with a brand are all for not if the end product or service is lacking. No one is going to recommend a bad product just because the customer service was top notch.
Taking it a step further, some customers stick with a brand they dislike if their product or service is good.
It’s easy to say that the key to gaining brand advocates is to create an amazing product – every company tries to offer good products. The key is to make adjustments based on research until you’ve got it right.
Another aspect that can’t be ignored is reliability.
When most people hear reliability, they assume that it means something that works correctly or is dependable 100% of the time. Obviously, this isn’t possible, even for the most sturdy and durable products or most committed brands.
However, reliability does require a level of responsibility that far exceeds the average. When a customer is in need, a reliable brand responds accurately.
The best way to stay reliable is to truly listen to customers and figure out how their requirements might have changed.
Identify advocates; encourage advocacy
Do you know why it’s so important to understand who your brand advocates are? We sometimes forget that just because an advocate asks on our behalf, doesn’t mean that we can’t be proactive.
Finding our brand advocates
When a brand knows who their advocates are, they can stay ahead of the feedback their next project is bound to receive. For example, if a brand is planning on releasing a new product line within the next three months, they could notify and connect with their advocates about it.
Furthermore, a brand advocate is much more willing to give valuable insight into your recent services, helping build your feedback without having to bother unwilling customers for comments and/or criticisms.
If you need some extra help researching and finding new brand advocates, consider a software system such as Hootsuite to handle the workload for you.
Encouraging advocacy
Remember that just because a customer is a brand advocate doesn’t mean that you can’t nudge them in the right direction to share a little more.
In fact, there are a lot of brand advocates who would love to spread your brand message but are limited by accessibility or other factors.
How do we fix this? The simplest answer is to seek out unique, creative ways to encourage advocacy. For example, some brands offer rewards for recommending them to a friend or family member.
More recently, brands have put easy-to-share links on digital products and services that further incentivize advocacy.
Don’t forget that this type of encouragement will only be effective on those who already wish to advocate for your brand. Offering a reward to share a bad product isn’t going to work.
Companies who embolden advocacy
Here are some companies to serve as an example of a good strategy to promote advocacy:
Coca-Cola
Coca-Cola is one of the best examples of a brand who promotes advocacy effectively. There are quite a few campaigns that stand out as powerful ways to create new advocates. I’ll discuss my personal favorites.
First, there was the ingenious ‘Share a Coke’ campaign, which involved printing the words “Share a Coke with…” and common names were printed, giving customers a chance to buy one of the sodas and give it to their friend, coworker or family member if they shared that name.
Not only was this a really good idea, creating a lot of buzz and togetherness as a result, but it also directly encouraged advocacy. Certainly, it’s a powerful way to get someone to spread the word about your brand around.
Another campaign they ran was the ‘Happiness Machine’ project, where special Coke vending machines were set up in public, only to purposely malfunction and give more soda than purchased (a lot more, in fact).
These moments were captured on camera and spread via the internet, mostly on YouTube. The videos showed people laughing, sharing and enjoying the fun brought on by the Coke machine’s ‘error’.
Starbucks
The popular coffee chain came up with a great idea to generate and potentially identify brand advocates. Their ‘Tweet-a-coffee’ program gave customers the option to use social media to purchase coffee for others.
Part of the reason this was so successful is because it promoted social togetherness, which always bodes well for a brand’s image.
Another reason this was such a positive for Starbucks is they were able to use the social media purchases and identify future brand advocates that they could consult for other projects or feedback.
Closing thoughts
Marketing with the intention of creating brand advocates should be integrated into your everyday marketing processes if you truly want to succeed. Think of the many ways you can provide customers with a great experience and product, then push onward to encourage advocacy.
Chances are, there are more brand advocates within your potential reach than you think. Once you begin looking for them, and helping them along, they’ll start to appear everywhere. Good luck!

56,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-assets/,"What are brand assets? 5 examples from brands you know
October 26, 2020|
If someone asked you to take a detailed survey of your brand assets, would you be able to?
After reading this article, you’ll have all the tools you need to understand everything about brand assets: what they are, their value, how they differ from other assets and more.
To get the most out of your brand assets, you need to understand what they are and why they matter. Fortunately, it’s really easy. Here’s a simple guide.
What are brand assets?
Brand assets are elements, such as a color scheme, jingle or font, that help identify a specific brand. These elements become brand assets only when customers associate them with a brand. If an element leads the audience to a different but similar brand, that element is not an asset.
It’s simple to remember when one of these brand elements are assets or not. Think of it like this: in order for it to be an asset, it has to connect an audience to your brand – and this has to happen fully, not partly. A jingle that makes customers think of socks isn’t an asset unless it makes customers think of the socks your brand makes and sells.
Well-known examples of brand assets
Seeing some well-known examples of brand assets helps clarify the concept. Before I dive into those, first let’s rundown some common elements to help further define brand assets:
- Color schemes
- Packaging
- Logos
- Jingles
- Company name
- Slogan
- Songs/sounds
Remember, these are just elements that can become an asset – having a jingle or a logo doesn’t mean you have a brand asset. Now let’s look at some of the most popular brand assets out there.
The Microsoft color scheme
What it is: The Microsoft color scheme is definitely one-of-a-kind, bringing four colors together – orange, green, yellow and blue.
The actual color names are unique to the logo. They are: Orioles Orange, Apple Green, Selective Yellow and Vivid Cerulean. Even logos that share the same four base colors are still ultimately different from Microsoft’s color scheme.
Why it’s an asset: The colors are a specific shade, but that’s not all. They’re also in a certain order within the Microsoft logo, making them unique to Microsoft.
They’re an asset because seeing those four colors together makes people think of Microsoft and their products, specifically Windows.
The Amazon packaging
What it is: It’s always apparent when a box is from Amazon and not another brand. There is a smile on the side of the box, and the tape used to seal it has details about Amazon specials.
Why it’s an asset: Someone walking down the street who sees a delivered Amazon package on a doorstep can immediately tell it’s from Amazon.
Apple’s half-bitten apple logo
What it is: The apple in Apple’s logo has a small bite taken out of the upper right corner. This iconic image has come in different colors over the years. It’s currently usually gray. However, if you’ve been using Apple products for a while, the previous version with rainbow colors might spring to your mind first.
Why it’s an asset: Any drawn picture of an apple with a bite out of the upper right is going to make people think of the brand Apple. Almost no one would mistake a Mac laptop to be a PC, simply because of the logo.
McDonald’s ‘i’m lovin’ it’ slogan and jingle
What it is: ‘I’m lovin’ it’ is a catchphrase that turned into a recognizable jingle. The slogan initially was meant to show an attitude about the food. When it was set to a jingle for TV and radio advertising, the memorable sound stuck in everyone’s brains . After a while, the jingle no longer needed any words to be known as McDonald’s.
Why it’s an asset: McDonald’s is able to run advertisements that play their jingle without words and get the audience to think of their brand. The jingle alone puts the words “I’m lovin’ it” into a customer’s head.
Disney’s Mickey Mouse mascot
What it is: Mickey is a cartoon character mouse that is seen in TV shows, films and in-person as a costumed actor in the Disney-themed amusement parks. Usually, just the mere image of mouse ears are enough to make people think of Mickey, and thus, Disney.
Why it’s an asset: Mickey Mouse is known globally, and whenever someone recognizes Mickey, they think of Disney.
The above examples give us insight into what types of brand elements turn into assets, but it’s not always so obvious. Let’s go over some ways to determine whether or not a company element is a brand asset.
How can I tell if a company element is a brand asset?
It’s obvious that brand assets are important, so how can we figure out whether our element is an asset or not? The answer doesn’t always stare us in the face.
Fortunately, with a few simple steps we can determine whether we have an asset on our hands.
Step 1 – The most common thing that brands forget to do when undertaking this process is mapping out their steps. Therefore, you’re already ahead of the competition.
Step 2 – Make sure to have a concrete evaluation plan for how you want to define brand elements.
Step 3 – With a plan in place, it’s time to evaluate your different elements. Take detailed inventory of the many elements your brand uses, as this will help determine their worth.
Step 4 – Next, you’ll need to work through some thorough analysis and market studies. This will help determine which elements truly make audiences think of your brand.
These simple steps will make it clear which of your elements are assets and which are not.
Determining the value of brand assets
No one can truly give you an actual, exact value of brand assets, but it’s clear that there is value in them. Furthermore, some assets bring about more value than others.
One way to consider this is the impact brand assets have on things like messaging. If customers recognize a brand based on a certain element, the overall messaging will be stronger.
This boosts conversions, as it builds a bridge between the marketing campaign and the sale. Due to other factors involved, it’s impossible to pin down the exact amount brand assets contributed but the fact remains the value is at least somewhat measurable.
Consider the effect your brand assets have on the effectiveness of advertisements. An asset within an ad gives customers a deeper understanding of brands involved. In turn, this promotes their positive attributes. Customers will remember that when they encounter the brand again making each successive ad more effective.
What’s the difference between brand assets and digital assets?
Last of all, you’ll probably hear the term ‘digital assets’ quite a bit, but make sure you don’t confuse it with brand assets. Here’s a quick breakdown of how they differ.
Digital assets are computerized files that include the right to use them. Things like digital images that you have created and own the rights to are digital assets.
Therefore, there will be times when your brand assets are digital assets (and vice versa). For example, if a logo is digitized it’s both a brand asset and a digital asset.
Wrapping things up
It’s impossible for a brand element to turn into an asset without some effort on your part. Similarly, you won’t be able to use your assets correctly if you can’t identify which elements work best.
So take a comprehensive approach to your brand assets to improve your chances of success.

57,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-association/,"How a memory becomes a sale: A guide to brand association
June 22, 2020|
“A brand that captures your mind gains behavior. A brand that captures your heart gains commitment.” – Scott Talgo
A brand that becomes associated with positive characteristics has a chance to corner the market and massively increase product sales.
To build these traits, it’s important to focus on the following:
- Visual design
- Personification
- Language
Brand association has the power to drive influence and sales. In this guide, you’ll learn what brand association is and how to create it. You’ll also be shown how to avoid negative associations. Let’s begin.
What is brand association?
Brand association is when company traits are rooted in customers’ minds. The goal of brand association is to have a brand linked with positive attributes. Brand association builds value and equity for a company brand. It ultimately makes consumers aware of brand quality.
When it comes to marketing, brand association is a straightforward concept: give audiences an association they would connect with.
If you’re highlighting new sunglasses for adults, for example, a campaign with younger millennials modeling the shades won’t put the right association into your audience’s head.
Here are some popular brand association examples most people have:
Google – search, information, answers
Apple – innovation, simplicity
Nike – sports, athletes, performance
Microsoft – windows, computers, software
Of course, some associations will run deeper than others. For example, when I think of Microsoft, I also think of the following:
- The multi-colored Windows logo
- A ‘start’ bar/menu
- Bill Gates
- Blue ‘Surface’ tablets
- Computers
- Efficiency, usefulness
- The memory of my first PC
Similarly, researching social data helps construct an idea of the types of things people are talking about when it comes to your brand. A powerful way to visualize this is by creating a word cloud. Here’s one I created using the above language I used for Microsoft:
And when I think of Google, I often see it as a noun and a verb. Someone may say they are going to ‘google’ something in lieu of ‘look something up’.
Some key examples to consider
For some, a logo might be the brand element they most associate with. For others, it might be a celebrity. Note that a human brand association is much more dynamic than a logo. Sure, a logo might get changed or, by no fault of its own, eventually mean something new (like the peace sign or a thumbs-up).
However, a celebrity or other type of human brand association is more likely to change, for better or worse. Many people think ‘Flo’ when they hear about the company Progressive, ‘Jan’ when they see a Toyota symbol or Jeff Goldblum when they think of buying a new apartment.
These are powerful brand associations to create, but they are destined to change. People age, make new decisions with their lives and create new personas. This has the potential to damage a brand with a negative association. For example, a popular human brand association was once Jared and Subway.
These examples give us a good understanding of why creating brand associations is so important. Let’s take a look at some direct benefits brand association creates.
The simplistic, yet drastically important, aspects of brand associations
Consumers are likely to interact with your brand if it builds unique, creative and positive associations with them.
These associations can be reciprocal as well. For example, watching a golf tournament Tiger Woods is playing in might make you think of Nike products. Similarly, seeing a Nike hat at the store might make you think of Tiger Woods.
This type of reciprocation drives sales and keeps brands on the mind.
It sounds simplistic sometimes, but it has validity. Think of a time when your purchase was influenced by a brand association. Chances are you didn’t feel tricked into buying something, rather, you were likely happy to make the purchase based on this association.
Knowing all this, it’s important to construct campaigns that build powerful brand associations. There are right and wrong ways to do this, so let’s make sure you follow the right path.
Necessary foundations to build
The following are some key ways to attempt to build your own brand associations:
1. Visuals/designs
“Math is easy; design is hard.” Jeffrey Veen
Visuals are one of the most effective ways to build a strong association and are a large part of brand identity. This is probably because a lot of advertisements are able to put forth different symbols and designs, whereas using a scent would be tough in many mediums.
The idea is to position a logo, design, symbol or visual element so that it induces nostalgic, happy memories.
Part of this is understanding the target audience, while part of it is understanding what types of visuals work best. For example, notice that brands that promote products for kids usually have things like cartoon animals and friendly characters on the packaging.
One powerful example of visual brand association campaigns is Coca-Cola’s drawn Santa Claus. Their packaging, cans and bottles had cartoon Santas, as well as other festive, seasonal elements such as falling snow.
Gaining this association meant that Coke was influencing consumers to link all their happy thoughts about the winter season and holidays with drinking a Coca-Cola.
It’s important to note that not every attempt will be successful. If Pepsi tried to replicate this design campaign, drawing Santa and snow onto each of their packages and products, it would likely flop. The Pepsi colors just don’t fit with a red Santa the way the Coke colors do.
Understand and respect your own limitations, because they will play a big role in overall success.
2. Language
It’s often possible to create a brand association by simply using the right type of language within each campaign.
For example, if you want to link your brand to boxing, a language representative of the sport would be ideal. Terms knockout, punch, block, etc. should be prevalent in your ads. Consider how this vocabulary affects your brand persona, as well.
Also, the language should meet at least a level of semblance tone-wise that indicates the campaign is from a boxing-informed brand.
The best way to assure you’re addressing this correctly is by confirming if you’re using the right vocabulary and if the tone is working. If these two things are adhered to, as well as brand consistency, things should be fine.
Here are a few popular campaigns that used language in order to create a powerful brand association:
The multi-colored candy is associated with a beautiful rainbow, thanks to the genius language and phrasing of the ‘taste the rainbow’ campaign.
Volkswagen’s creative use of language sparked associations between their vehicles and a convenient or ‘right’ size.
It’s clear to see how creative language and vocabulary can transform a brand. Think of ways your language could change for the better.
3. Personification
This is most relevant to brands that have inanimate products, but enough innovation could allow for many brands to use personification.
Personification is the act of giving something nonhuman human traits and characteristics. It is a large part of brand image. An iconic example of this is Wilson, the volleyball that Tom Hanks befriends in the movie ‘Castaway’.
Personification is effective because it changes the way audiences view items and creates emotional connections where it seemed impossible. It also allows for a more direct communication between the once-inanimate object and consumers.
One of the best uses of personification by a brand was the ‘I’m a Mac’ campaign by Apple. Instead of comparing their physical computer with a PC, they simply ran an ad with two humans who represented personified versions of the computers.
This way, they gave their lifeless product life, as well as humor, intelligence, youth and personality.
Keep these different ways to create positive associations in mind during your next campaign.
The negatives and how to recover from them
Companies do everything they can to create brand associations, but they aren’t able to control the outcomes. No matter how good of intentions you have going into it, sometimes a negative brand association is inevitable.
This is a huge problem when it happens, since it means customers will choose competitors over you.
So, why does this end up happening? The answer lies in the information outlets available to everyone. There are so many ways for consumers and the media to relay information and form whatever opinions they want about a brand. This is just the reality, there is no changing it.
Even though this is an unavoidable possibility, there are ways to reduce the chances of it happening. The first way is simple: work hard to create positive brand associations. The more active we are in this process, the less chances of a negative association forming.
The second way to prevent a negative association is by being aware of current events and maintaining strong quality control.
There are plenty of harmful associations – you probably can think of a few off the top of your head. Consistency is the key to avoid becoming one of the unfortunate brands caught up in a bad situation.
Ready to get started? let’s begin!
Now that you have a handle on brand associations, it’s time to begin building your own. Figure out your brand’s current associations to get a foundational understanding. Next, come up with other things you’d like consumers to associate with your brand.
With these goals set, you’ll be able to work with your teams to create the ideal brand associations. Remember to be consistent and keep the main principles in mind throughout the process. Good luck!

September 5, 2020|
The most powerful moments in stories are when characters discover the solution to their problems by looking inward.
These moments are compelling because the audience expects external, rather than internal, hurdles.
This principle holds true for brands. Success is possible only with a genuine dedication to self-reflection and a commitment to values.
The result of such a positive effort is brand authenticity, which is a major key to success.
This guide will walk you through the unique ways to create authenticity in a manner that fits your goals and vision.
What is brand authenticity?
Brand authenticity happens if a target audience decides that a brand is true to its ideals, honest with its customers and fully transparent. An authentic brand makes real connections with customers through genuine communication, extensive reliability and selfless caring.
“Authenticity requires vulnerability, transparency and integrity.” – Janet Louise Stephenson
So, why is brand authenticity important?
Research has shown time and time again that a company’s truthfulness and sincerity influences its overall brand image. That is to say, the more authentic a brand, the better it is seen by audiences.
This translates to favorability, giving honest and genuine brands a better chance at making sales over competitors.
As you can see, brand authenticity comes with many positive rewards. Let’s get you on the path to success. Here are five ways to build your own brand authenticity.
Be your true brand self: 5 tips to boost brand authenticity
1. Sincerity is only possible if we stick to our ideals
To progress towards authenticity, you must assume that everyone in your target market is a skeptic.
Now, when we approach our branding with a skeptical audience in mind, it becomes clear that the way to win their trust is through sincerity.
Keep in mind that sincerity is black and white. It’s sincere or insincere. There is no alternative, and there is no faking it. Trust me, skepticism isn’t quelled by catchy taglines or prisoner-of-the-moment statements.
It takes a continued commitment to sincerity in order to win your target market and gain true authenticity.
All this being said, what is the best way we can show sincerity? The answer lies in how well we stick to our ideals.
What are brand ideals?
Brand ideals are the ultimate purpose of a brand that goes deeper than the products they offer. Brand ideals give a brand its philosophical meaning and shows how it wants to better its community and the rest of the world.
How do we build our brand ideals?
In order to come up with brand ideals, we need to pinpoint our purpose. In what way does our brand have a higher calling? What are some of its meaningful goals that go beyond profits? How does it practice brand differentiation?
Whatever we settle on, it needs to be clear. Anyone who knows of our brand should also know what it stands for. For example, Honda isn’t just trying to sell cars; they’re selling family safety. Gerber isn’t just a baby food company; it’s a brand committed to keeping babies healthy.
Now that you have a better understanding of brand ideals, let’s take a look at one example that demonstrates a brand sticking to their ideals:
The Herbivore Clothing Company is committed to animal-free products and other accessories which promote a cruelty-free lifestyle.
They go above and beyond to stick to their ideals (and demonstrate sincerity) by offering a list of all the vegan establishments in their surrounding area to customers.
At no cost to the customer, and with no ulterior motive, The Herbivore Clothing Company shows true brand authenticity by caring for animals.
If they announced a partnership with Burger King in order to better promote their newest vegan sandwich, their perceived sincerity would be gone for good.
Even if they apologized, it would be too little too late.
Sincerity can’t be faked, and ideals are only as good as the brand behind them.
2. An honest brand is an authentic brand (so be honest)
“The greatest homage we can pay to truth, is to use it.” – James Russell Lowell
I’m willing to bet that you can name quite a few brands who have been dishonest, in one way or another.
Some of these brands might even still be around, but it’s equally likely that their dishonest moment isn’t forgotten.
It sounds like a no-brainer, yet so many make the mistake of lying or withholding information to their target audience anyway.
Nobody needs a step-by-step guide explaining how to be honest. So instead, I’m going to break down the ways to increase your honesty while avoiding dishonest behaviors.
Don’t backtrack on a promise or make a false claim
As obvious as it seems, brands get caught doing this all the time. In an episode of the iconic show ‘Seinfeld’, Kramer invests in a non-fat yogurt store.
Customers flock to the location, only to find they’re gaining weight from it. As it turns out, the yogurt was misrepresented as non-fat.
As funny as this episode was, there are real-life examples that make it impossible for brands to claim they’re honest or delivering what they promise.
Also keep in mind that your honesty separates you from the competition. Consider three similar brands that sell a pain-reducing pill. It takes four hours for relief from all three pills.
Now, imagine that two of these brands claimed their pill was an ‘instant-relief’ pain pill, while the third took an honest approach.
Initially, the ‘instant-relief’ brands may come out on top, until customers realize the dishonesty. At that point, they’ll see the third brand as superior.
Be as available as you can
It’s disappointing when you’re unable to ask a company a question (or receive an answer). If something goes wrong with a product, it’s reassuring when the company presents itself and is available to help, rather than making it impossible to get into contact.
Be willing to answer inquiries with confidence (and of course, honesty). The reality of the situation is, if you hide from questions, you’ve got something to hide – at least in the minds of your audience.
One popular way to do this is through social media. In fact, customers are asking more and more questions on social media platforms, and they’re expecting valid responses. Make sure you’re accessible and helpful on all major social media sites.
Be as transparent as possible
If you’ve ever taken a multivitamin or other, you’re well aware of the practices different companies take in listing ingredients. Some list every ingredient and its amount; others throw specific elements into a ‘proprietary blend’.
These blends are then given a sneaky nickname to make them sound fancy, when really they’re a way for the company to hide ingredients.
No matter how flawed the truth is, brand transparency trumps secrecy. A great example of this is Taco Bell’s meat. They didn’t cover up anything when it came to their ingredients. They instead admitted that it was only 88% meat. The popular fast food restaurant then listed what went into the other 12%.
Now, clearly they would have preferred if they could have said it was 100% meat, but being transparent and admitting flaws boosted their brand more than a coverup would have.
3. Find unique ways to heighten communication
Technological advances have made it possible to build intimate relationships with customers. There are many different ways to communicate now, and customers expect it.
Here are a few different methods to get your communication on track.
Hit the right pitch so that your communication doesn’t sound like a pitch
Humans are social creatures by nature – we love to communicate! Furthermore, we enjoy laidback, obligation-free communication.
What people don’t like is communication that feels ominous, where at any moment the voice on the other end of the phone is about to attempt a sale.
Even the most unobservant reader will pick up on the fact that your tone sounds like a marketing pitch. It’s up to you to present a conversational feel to messages.
What’s the best way to accomplish this? The most important thing to remember is that communication is all about showing an understanding. We need to show to our customers that we understand them.
Next, we need to let them know that we’re on the same level when speaking to them. Truly listen, truly understand and look for ways to allow customers to engage. Show them it’s allowed and encouraged to speak up about what types of things are valuable to them.
Personalization
The most successful brands go out of their way to communicate personally with their customers, even if they don’t build an elaborate brand persona. They even go as far as understanding local issues, even if they’re not a local brand.
Imagine you’re in the need for a new automobile. You enter a car lot, looking specifically for a vehicle which meets the highest safety standards.
A car salesperson approaches and asks what you’re looking for. You tell them a black or green mid-size sedan with great safety features.
They lead you to a red sedan. Apart from the color being wrong, you also notice it doesn’t have the safety features you were looking for. Puzzled, you ask the salesperson why they chose this car for you.
They tell you that it’s their most popular sedan and that it’s extremely fast.
This example illustrates the importance of personalization in communication. There is no blanket way to talk to people. Even if most people love a fast car, not everyone does.
Make conversations meaningful
We know how important it is to communicate in the right tone and personalize our contact. With these important factors in mind, we can focus on making all conversations meaningful.
So how do we go about doing this? First, picture how you would like a conversation to go if you were a customer. You’d likely want more than a standardized response, such as, “So and so brand thanks you for your continued service”.
Imagine how much more engaged you would be if they asked thoughtful questions. Think of how it would make you feel if a brand had a genuine conversation with you.
Determine ways to improve current customer conversations and make adjustments. Chances are your customers will feel more connected to you.
4. First know, next appreciate, your customer
Most brands seem to understand half of this equation – they know their customer. However, only the successful brands both know and appreciate customers.
That’s not to say that one is more important than the other, but it’s clear that authenticity can’t be reached without both. Let’s make sure you have a detailed understanding and appreciation of customers.
Know your customers
When I say that it’s important to know your customer, this is different from knowing your target market, though the two overlap.
Think of it this way: you want to know who your customer is and what they’re about. Basically, you need to understand them.
Now, in order to truly understand customers, you have to remember this: they’re always changing. Therefore, their needs are changing as well. If you adapt to these new changes, you’ll be authentic in the eyes of customers.
Appreciate your customers
It’s pretty simple, as a customer, to sense when a brand appreciates you and when they don’t. Also, it doesn’t take much for a lifelong sense of appreciation to sour.
As such, it’s vital to show genuine appreciation for customers. Here are some key ways to accomplish this:
1. Focus your projects around customers
It’s easy to feel appreciated as a customer if it seems like everything a business does is designed for your benefit. Make customers the center of your focus and ensure they understand they are extremely important to you.
2. Show you care with actions, not ads
Brands get caught up in telling their customers how much they care in marketing campaigns and advertisements that they sometimes forget the most important part – following through. Therefore, think of heartfelt ways to appeal to customers and work to accomplish them.
A popular fast-food restaurant once ran a promotion that stated they’ll comp an order if their employee doesn’t greet you properly.
On paper, this seemed like a reasonable enough idea. They were making sure their customers were treated kindly upon each visit. This seemed like good PR for the brand.
However, many restaurants didn’t seem to understand the importance of follow-through, as customers were argued with and/or denied their free order when they made a claim.
Having to fight a brand for a promise they made doesn’t make customers feel appreciated. Make sure your brand actually cares, rather than just promotes that they do.
5. Stay consistently reliable
“Creativity isn’t worth a thing if it isn’t served with an equal amount of reliability.” – Anton Peck
One of the paths to authenticity is paved in reliability. How well do you come through when counted on?
This doesn’t mean that a service or product you provide needs to work without error all the time. Instead, it’s how you behave in situations where customers’ need you. It is meeting the levels of expectation customers have.
In order to meet this expectation, we have to put our ear to the ground and learn what our customers want. The more informed we are, the more accurate (and reliable) our decisions will be.
Here are some unique ways to be reliable.
1. Remember that mistakes are fixable
Many of the most successful brands make serious mistakes that put their brand authenticity in jeopardy. The actions they take in response is what makes them succeed or fail.
If a brand stands for making the world a safer place, then releases a product that is unintentionally dangerous, customers will feel it’s not adhering to brand consistency and isn’t reliable.
The brand will have to prove that this mistake isn’t representative of their overall body of work. Otherwise, it will appear like they don’t care about safety, and thus, are not reliable.
2. Plan for uncertainty and change
“When nothing is sure, everything is possible.” – Margaret Drabble
Imagine for a moment that you’re a national brand of brick-and-mortar retail stores in the 1990s. Your company prides itself on offering returns on every product in the store – all that’s required is a receipt and a few questions asked.
Now, regardless of how good that makes customers think of your brand, fast-forward a few years to the Amazon era. The e-commerce giant offers returns with no questions asked.
Certainly, an update to your services is the only way to keep up.
This type of change and uncertainty is a common occurrence, and the only way to be seen as reliable is to evolve when necessary.
One example that stands out is Dropbox, a cloud-based storage service that managed to increase the effectiveness of its service year-by-year.
No matter what obstacles they have to overcome, they pull through by committing to change and improvements.
One thing that comes to mind was the hackings that slammed Dropbox’s servers. It had been improving its security slowly but surely, and that was part of its promise.
Because of their response and efforts to build their security even further, it showed they were authentic.
Reflecting on your own brand: Is it authentic?
Creating true brand authenticity takes considerable effort, inner-reflection and commitment. An authentic brand has put in the work to stand for something great and stick to their ideals.
It’s not easy, but that doesn’t mean it’s complicated. Just be true to your values and respectful at all times. The best brands exist to help the customer, and what better way to help them than through a genuine relationship.

September 6, 2020|
Have you ever asked for Coca-Cola at a restaurant, only to be disappointed when they had Pepsi?
Have you seen a friendly debate over whether Ford or Chevy were the superior automobile? Were you shocked by the passion both parties brought to their side?
At face value, these disappointments and disagreements seem silly. Surely there isn’t much difference between Coke and Pepsi – both are cola with a similar look, feel and taste.
Furthermore, Ford and Chevy produce roughly the same type of automobiles with equal quality and pricing.
These ‘line-in-the-sand’ stances demonstrate the power of brand awareness, syncing a brand with a target audience’s way of life, spending patterns and preferences.
Brand awareness cements an idea of superiority into their minds, which lasts a lifetime.
In this article, I’ll make it easy for you to grasp all the basic concepts of brand awareness, then help you weave them into your campaigns.
Let’s make your next project stronger and substantially boost your brand.
What is brand awareness?
Brand awareness is how well consumers recognize traits of a particular brand, such as their unique qualities. Brand awareness extends further than simply recognizing a logo or jingle. The stronger the brand awareness, the likelier that a brand is popular.
Brand awareness is how customers react or feel when they see a specific brand element. Keep this in mind going forward, since it’s easy to mistake recognition with awareness.
What makes it so valuable?
Building brand awareness has a direct effect on brand equity. Brand equity is a measurable value that is created based on company reputation. When customers are aware of a specific brand’s quality, they choose their products over competitors.
Customer awareness increases brand equity because it allows companies to charge a premium for their products or services.
Similar to increasing equity, brand awareness also makes it easier to develop and release new products, ideas and services.
This is because the risk of failure is lower when customers trust your brand, are attached to it and are willing to buy your products based on brand loyalty.
As you can see, a little bit of awareness goes a long way. Let’s dive into some key tips.
Fundamental ways to bolster brand awareness
You need some basic requirements to be met in order to entice customers. Take a look at some of these important ways to improve.
Make your brand definable to customers
If your target market would struggle to define your brand, chances are they wouldn’t purchase a product or service from it either.
Think of your brand like a movie. In what ways would a film fanatic describe it to somebody else? Would they be able to give specific details that define the movie and make it unique? Would they be able to say more than “action film” or “comedy flick”?
Figure out which characteristics you want it to have and present to audiences. Just like a movie is more than just a ‘Thriller’, your brand is more than just a company that takes customer money. Make your brand definable as much as possible!
When it comes to engagement, think outside-the-box
Consider how your brand situates itself on different platforms. Is the content easily-accessible? Would it be considered share-friendly? Does it appear to have ulterior motives? Is it an altruistic brand trying to help its audience?
There are so many ways to reach audiences now that we might slip into a routine when delivering our content. Brand consistency and routine are one thing, but complacency is another.
In order to truly engage our target audience, some creative thinking is needed. Certainly, the quality of our content drives awareness. However, there’s much more we can do to reach customers.
Understanding the way your brand engages, through things like articles and social media posts, is the first step into building up a strong brand awareness.
Awareness requires (at least) an initial connection. Reach out and make it meaningful!
Imagine receiving a newsletter about a sale. Inside, it gives details such as the date, location and pricing.
You might be satisfied with this, since sales are a good thing. However, now consider that this newsletter comes ten times per month, with details about specials and sales.
Chances are, this wouldn’t make you feel too important. Now imagine a newsletter that gives updates about its company, how they’re responding to issues you’re dealing with and how they plan on going forward in the future.
This would be a more meaningful connection. Remember, there’s no substitute for sincerity!
Creative approaches to extend your brand awareness outreach
“To me, when you have unaided brand awareness above 30 percent, you have a mass market brand.” – Robert Pittman
Now that you’ve built a foundation and given customers a chance to favor your brand, it’s important to further its outreach. Here are some unique methods to help.
Change, improve or add to your brand persona
If you took a step back to evaluate your brand’s personality, how would you think about it? Would you feel like it was an extension of a person? Would this person have characteristics you value?
If it seems like your brand persona doesn’t answer these important values, consider ways to implement change. Look for places to alter the way future campaigns represent your brand on a personal level.
Furthermore, figure out unique ways to add to your personality. Tinker with different parts here and there but keep the main persona the same.
Consider reducing your content output to increase quality
“So in fact, narrowing down our choices means less overwhelm, and more creativity.” – Courtney Carver
There’s a thin line between putting out a lot of new content and spamming. To customers who get bombarded with different marketing campaigns, advertisements and clickbait every single day, your latest piece of content could be off-putting.
How do we avoid this? In what ways can we ensure our content is delivered to eager audiences who are happy to receive it?
One way is to reduce our overall output of content creation. If our target audience is getting three ‘Tweets’ per day notifying them of new articles and posts, they might just unfollow the brand.
Reducing how much content we’re creating makes for stronger pieces. We’re able to go more in-depth on topics, making articles credible and interesting.
Furthermore, this decision increases customer loyalty. When your audience feels they’re getting something of value rather than another unoriginal piece, they’ll feel more connected to your brand.
At the end of the day, empty mass advertising doesn’t drive brand awareness – it might do the opposite.
Show confidence in your service or product
Every business suggests, in one way or another, that their specific product or service is of high-quality. This is a standard position, and no one is swayed bye self-proclaimed greatness.
As such, it goes without saying that any praise you shower on your own products or services will fall on deaf ears.
Instead, show that you’re confident in your products. There are quite a few ways to do this. The first way is to give a free trial. This not only lets the customer try before they buy, but it shows you believe they’ll like it once they get to actually use it.
Another way, which won’t be a fit for everyone, is some sort of money-back guarantee. This is also entering ‘falling on deaf ears’ territory, but there are ways around that. You could try to improve on the offer by promising money-back with an extra bonus. A few companies have done this, giving unsatisfied customers their money back as well as something extra.
Whatever the method, make sure it stands out and represents a complete confidence in your services.
Create a YouTube channel and release scheduled content
“Humans are incredibly visual and powerful, moving images help us find meaning… [and] video helps capture and contextualize the world around us.” – Dan Patterson
YouTube is a low-cost platform to boost brand awareness and build a loyal customer base. Creating a branded channel connects you with users who are familiar with you, and also those who haven’t yet discovered the brand.
Making videos on YouTube is a straightforward process, requiring minimal technical know-how.
The great thing about releasing YouTube videos on a schedule (weekly, monthly, etc.) is it promotes your brand without advertising. It also builds credibility, giving you a powerful way to inform audiences about new happenings within your areas of expertise.
Some tips to help evaluate your brand awareness
Now that you have some exciting new ways to approach building brand awareness, it’s important to follow through with a periodic evaluation of your success.
It’s not always easy to evaluate how well your brand is holding up in the market, but there are some unique methods to give you a general idea.
Closing thoughts
When it comes to brand awareness, think big! You have a chance to build something special that could change major functions for the better.
Apply the unique approaches we discussed to gain important connections with your audience. These valuable relationships turn into customer loyalty over time.

“Communication works for those who work at it.” – John Powell
Well-executed brand communication breeds loyalty, helps you stand out and shows audiences who you are. Fortunately, the pathways to communication have grown and expanded, and continue to do so.
Don’t let the opportunities provided by strong brand communication pass you by. This article is a comprehensive guide to improving all facets of brand communication.
What is brand communication?
Brand communication is the way in which a brand interacts with audiences through advertisements, social media and more. Whenever a customer or client reads something written by a brand, sees one of their ads or logos or speaks to their representatives, they are communicating with that brand.
All too often, we think of communication as defined by two parties having some type of dialogue. This restricts the possibilities of communication that can help a brand thrive. Instead, think of brand communication in the sense of every time your target market sees something your brand produces, you have made a connection.
Now that you have an idea of what brand communication is, let’s take a look at why it’s so important.
Benefits of strong brand communication
Everyone instinctively knows that good brand communication has many benefits, though they might not know exactly which ones. Here are some of the most important benefits, as well as a few lesser-known ones. Use these as a way to drive forward communication goals.
Builds brand loyalty
When we feel the lines of communication are open and flowing back and forth meaningfully, we’re likely to stick with that brand.
Just as a customer might inform others of their negative experience communicating with a brand, they’ll do so when they have a positive experience as well. This is invaluable, since it will likely result in more brand loyalty, and those initial customers might bring even more people along with them.
Helps a brand stand out
Just as important as communicating thoughtfully is the idea of doing something better than your competitors. Think of the potential double-benefit that comes with creating a strong commutative relationship with your customer, all while competitors in your industry fail to do so successfully.
When customers begin seeing a brand as different from its peers in terms of communication, they will also see their products and services as different. It’s much more likely that a customer will buy a product from a brand who they’ve created an emotional bond with, even if the price and quality isn’t as good as others.
Gives brands a chance to show their values
Sometimes, all it takes is a brief newsletter to have a big impact on a customer, especially if the content expresses a brand’s values and ideals. Think of all the ways a brand that is important to you has won your trust and expressed their thoughtful values in communication.
It’s not a matter of bragging, either. It’s simply a matter of transparency. Without communicating certain ideas to your audiences, how can they ever learn the ways in which your brand operates?
With these benefits in mind, let’s take a look at how to best build a powerful brand communication strategy.
Constructing a brand communication strategy
It’s easy to commit to extended brand communication. However, it’s not always easy to put this plan into action. Therefore, it’s crucial to construct some type of brand communication strategy. I’ve developed some ideas that you’ll need in order to make your strategy comprehensive and effective.
Evaluate and select the most intriguing communication platforms
Don’t let assumptions and habits restrict potential outlets for communication. Each brand is going to have different types of customers who use unique platforms.
The research you do should give you a base understanding of where you want to spend most of your communication efforts. The next part of your evaluation should be of the platform itself. Make sure that your brand is using it correctly to maximize results.
Be aware of your tone and perfect it
It’s safe to assume most brands are familiar with their audience, at least in terms of their core demographics. However, not every brand delivers the right voice or tone in their communication with audiences.
Identifying this is the first step. This applies to all types of communication on many different platforms. Once it’s clear the ways in which you want to communicate, look to sharpen your voice in this regard.
Set communication goals
It sounds a little strange to hear that we should set goals for our communication, but it’s an important part of successful branding. Goals give you a chance to visualize what’s most important and makes it easier to have a concrete idea how to achieve it.
Part of your goals should include pleasing your audience with the right types of communication, but also should outline how it can benefit the brand as well. Think of it in terms of using the conversations you’ll be having to shine the light on specific brand areas you can then improve.
Once you’ve determined your brand communication goals, come up with a few ways to measure these goals. Schedule a periodic check of different factors to ensure your goals are being met, then make adjustments as necessary.
With your strategy in place, it’s time to look at the ways we can master our communication.
Top brand communication tips
The following helpful hints will give you a foundation for communicating effectively with your audiences.
1. Encourage your audience to pass it on
It makes sense that your best pieces of communication should be seen by the most people. Make it easy for audiences to pass your content on to others. This can be done in numerous ways.
The first step to accomplish this, of course, is to create communications that are helpful, interesting and brand-relevant. Think of different types of communication in terms of a good food recipe. Even before the internet, people shared recipes with one another all the time. The more helpful, interesting and important the information, the more likely it will get shared.
Next, you’ll want to use different channels and formats for your message. If you believe most of your target market won’t want to or be able to share a certain type of file or format, opt for something that is more accessible and easier to spread around.
2. Repetition and regularity are required
It’s unlikely that reaching out only once with your audience will be effective on a large scale. It’s also unlikely that your customers and potential customers would only want a one-time communication before all conversations ceased.
There are, of course, thresholds your communication efforts can meet that sour the relationship (such as communicating too often), so look for a sweet spot that is enough to inspire and spread brand awareness but not overboard. Once this is decided upon, stick to this schedule to maximize the efficacy of your communications.
3. Be transparent at all times
During all forms of communication, the more you’re able to adhere to brand transparency, the better. Nothing derails brand communication quicker than dishonesty, disingenuity or lack of transparency.
Transparency gives customers a chance to feel like they’re a bigger part of the brand. It shows that they are trusted, and their opinion is valid and truly matters. Transparency builds loyalty, earns respect and helps customers have a better understanding of your brand.
4. Show your values and stay true to them
It’s a mistake to believe that the only chance we get to share our brand values is on our company website. Each time we communicate with our audiences is a great opportunity to offer up your main message and core values. By delivering these values in our message, we provide audiences with an understanding of what they can continue to expect from us.
Next time you’re constructing a brand element that audiences will see, keep in mind the ways in which it portrays the brand. How well are the values represented? Did you define your brand ideals when you had the chance? Begin to think about this before you communicate on all different types of platforms.
5. Make your audience’s voices heard and valued
Don’t forget the basics of all communication, which is to limit your own voice and self-elevation. It’s easy for brands to make the mistake of overdoing this, often taking up too much of a conversation or communication space to pat themselves on the back or make a sales pitch. This is fine in tiny amounts, but if it dominates the entire conversation it will be a turn-off. Instead, only talk up your brand qualities when the situation calls for it.
Also, think about the ways your communication with customers takes place. Do they make customers feel valued? Are responses they receive friendly and open, offering a chance to give their own ideas or share their own experiences? Brands that are willing to have conversations beyond an automated response are often more connected with their customers, which keeps them around for much longer.
Now that you have an idea of how to strategize and build your communication, here are some examples of brands who do it right.
Some examples to consider
The following examples show brands that communicate effectively in their own unique way.
Starbucks
Starbucks has always pushed the boundaries of the customer-brand relationship in a good way. They’ve made an effort to communicate openly, honestly and in a humorous way. Many of their most inspiring brand communications came on their Twitter account.
This response not only gives the brand’s followers a chance to see that they responded to a customer, but also that their in-store practice (writing on the lid) was caring and thoughtful.
Again, Starbucks shows their willingness to respond while also getting a free chance to highlight the fact their employees treat customers well.
Dove
Dove has worked to inspire a positive impact from their brand communications, particularly when dealing with self-image of customers. Their ‘Dove Real Beauty Sketches’ campaign was an example of this type of brand communication. The advertisement was a chance to truly reach out to their audience and show them their values and caring side, instead of promoting a product.
Airbnb
Airbnb has some of the most unique communication pieces, particularly their newsletter and magazine. The creativity, quality and helpful information provided in each is constantly praised by their subscribers, and likely leads to future use of the brand’s service by customers.
Closing thoughts
There’s no telling how far an effort to consistently provide top notch brand communication can take you. It is pretty apparent, though, that the brands willing to put themselves out there are reaping the rewards.
Think about what your next piece of communication says about your brand. Craft it until it truly says what you want and how you want the customers who read it to feel.

August 3, 2020|
In 1985, the popular board game ‘Clue’ was turned into a movie of the same name. In order to prevent someone from giving away the mystery to the rest of the world, the director shot three different endings for different locations and theaters.
If three people went to different theaters, then discussed the film afterward, they might all have unknowingly seen completely different versions of the same film.
Eventually, one might even ask the others if they’re certain they watched the movie, ‘Clue’, and not something different.
In the case of the film world, this was an interesting tactic that preserved a mystery from being revealed. However, in the case of a brand, this strategy would have a lot of people scratching their heads.
When it comes to branding, it’s important to adhere to strict standards that unify all different functions of the brand.
That’s where brand compliance comes into effect. By focusing on compliance, brands are able to keep their values intact throughout each campaign. They’re also able to:
- Increase sales
- Boost communication
- Prevent branding errors
This article will give you the brand compliance strategies needed to uphold your main ideals. The last thing you want, after all, is three different people seeing completely contrasting versions of your brand.
What is brand compliance?
Brand compliance is an approach that maintains the fundamentals of a brand to prevent errors or misuse – it involves consistency in assets like images and logos. Brand compliance structures projects and campaigns so that messaging and other elements stay true to brand values.
Compliance is different for each brand. Sometimes, it entails a few simple examinations. Other times it’s a large-scale process.
For example, global brands have a lot more steps to take to keep their brand values intact all over the world.
There are many different ways to be compliant:
- Maintain visual elements
- Establish consistent messaging
- Uphold values and ideals through all communication
Before we go any further, let’s make sure you understand how we will use consistency throughout this article.
The word ‘consistency’ will come up a lot during a discussion about compliance. It does not refer to brand consistency directly. I will differentiate the two by using ‘brand consistency’ when referring to it directly.
So, how are they different? They’re actually very similar. Brand compliance is a function of brand consistency. If brand consistency were the finish line, brand compliance would be some of the steps you need to take to cross it.
The benefits of adopting a successful brand compliance strategy are immense, and the consequences from failing to do so can be devastating. Before building up our blueprint toward success, let’s explore the importance of staying compliant (or failing to do so).
Importance of brand compliance – potential positives and negatives
Just as valuable as understanding the good things that come with being compliant is an understanding of the negatives that come with failing to do so. Here are the most crucial positives and negatives to consider.
Positives
Brand compliance is more than just keeping the same-sized logo on different projects. It offers quite a few groundbreaking benefits that are rewarding and worth fighting for. Here are some to consider.
Improves your brand’s prominence
As we’ve observed with different kinds of brand loyalty, one of the main reasons customers stick with a brand is they are dependable and maintain their ideals in every situation.
The potential rewards of loyalty are notable, considering roughly 40 out of 100 people pay higher prices to use brands they’re loyal to.
60 out of those 100 customers end up telling others about the brand, becoming brand advocates themselves.
When considering what makes a brand so great, we often think of the ways in which it remains true to its many special aspects, such as values and ideals.
Compliance ensures that the best foot is always put forward. It’s important that all areas hit the right messages for each market they reach.
Brand consistency is something that really improves a brand’s standing with customers, and compliance is a large part of creating and sustaining consistency.
Increases sales
Upon first thought, brand compliance doesn’t seem to be a large factor in terms of sales. It is, after all, a marketing initiative.
Consider, though, the potential disconnect from a lack of compliance. The marketing team is putting forth one thing the audience sees, then they’re talking with another department that represents the brand. If they’re receiving different tones, something will feel off.
Just as bad brand compliance wastes potentially large sums of money from marketing campaigns and projects, good brand compliance allows for these projects and advertisements to lead to a better bottom line.
Note that there is a measurable benefit to compliance, as consistent branding increases total revenue by approximately 25%. Furthermore, 75% of customers expect brands to offer similar values from one channel to the next.
Negatives
Failing to uphold compliance can be devastating. Here are some negative aspects that clearly demonstrate this idea.
Erases the efforts and financial investments made by marketers on branding
There are not too many things worse than buying something and never using it. Parents of young children find that out quite often when they order a new toy, only to find their child enjoying the packaging box it arrives in instead of the actual product.
However, even worse than NOT using something is when you buy something and someone ruins it (kids do this to their new toys as well).
Without a legitimate, structured compliance, there is a huge risk for error or misuse. These are quite costly, potentially ruining years of work and plenty of investments by marketers who put their efforts into branding campaigns.
When you take into account that marketing campaigns on average are about 10-15% of a company’s total budget and growing all the time, this problem is amplified.
The following is a graph of the average marketing budget from 2014-2018 (courtesy Gartner):
Though it’s not a linear increase, it is still moving up over time.
If ever someone is unsure about moving forward with a comprehensive compliance plan, remind them of these consequences.
Communication errors and misinformation
“Words are the source of misunderstandings.” – Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
When it comes to communication, the type of contact is important, because it shows what they need and how you can provide it. When people contact brands, 80% of these communications are to ask for help or get more information.
If you’ve ever played a game of ‘Telephone’, you know how hard it is to get a message from one person to another.
You are also aware of how easy it would be to fix the broken message – simply have someone manage the process, acting as a quality control.
Brand compliance is a solution to the inconsistent messages and misinformation a brand sometimes spreads.
All too often organizations have branding issues resulting from different team members and departments sharing documents and other assets.
Similarly, when it comes to customers, conversations help building important relationships right away. In fact, the first three-to-four seconds generally make the biggest difference.
From these benefits and negative aspects, it’s clear that compliance is important and cannot be understated. Therefore, it’s necessary to maintain throughout all different endeavors.
With the right structure in place this is certainly possible. Here are five methods aimed at helping you stay compliant.
5 ways to maintain brand compliance
By following these strategies, you’ll have a powerful structure to keep your compliance from faltering at crucial moments.
1. Create a dedicated brand department
When the sun is out and people head to the beach, there’s usually a tower where dedicated lifeguards watch the waters for drowning swimmers.
That way, everyone at the beach can focus on enjoying themselves without having to constantly worry about other people’s safety. This is true for upholding consistent branding efforts as well.
It’s fair to say that all departments should be well-versed in compliance and should understand the branding standards set for them.
However, to add an extra layer of safety to this equation, consider assigning a department to monitor the entire process.
To go about this, clearly define and outline what they will do. It’s important that they’re clear on their tasks and schedule.
Generally, this team should understand compliance standards, then work to manage and maintain them by examining current branding efforts.
There’s no set standard for the size of this team, but it should typically have more working parts if it has more ground to cover (if a company is small, the team ensuring compliance doesn’t have to be massive).
Finally, don’t neglect to add periodic checks to this dedicated department. Without sufficient supervision, there runs the risk of a blind leading the blind situation.
2. Check and re-check your branding in different products and services
Chances are, your products and services will change occasionally. When they do, there’s potential for some failed disconnect in branding.
Similarly, these missteps are often marginal and go unnoticed, since a large miscue would be easy to spot and correct.
Therefore, it’s important to have a system set up to evaluate the current and upcoming services and products for consistency.
The only way to make this work effectively is by keeping it routine. Schedule periodic evaluations to products so that nothing slips through undetected.
What types of things are being evaluated here? Mainly, how well the product or service upholds and represents the main ideals, values and mission of the brand.
Remember that most of all, this process will help new products sell better, as they’ll be consistent with all the factors customers like about your brand.
3. Entice employees to get involved with the compliance efforts
“To win in the marketplace you must first win in the workplace.” – Doug Conant
If you’ve ever watched a sports match that requires participants to wear uniforms, you understand how funny it can be when someone puts their jersey on wrong.
They often become the center of attention and halt the event, while their teammates have a good laugh at their expense while they fix their wardrobe.
Even though these incidents are funny and lighthearted, when a similar mishap happens with brand standards, the results aren’t so cute.
It’s not always a given that all departments are on board with branding efforts. So how do we go about making sure they are?
First, make sure the right people are demonstrating and talking about compliance, in some capacity. Next, consider some ways to offer brand testing and education that is exciting and outlines how beneficial the results will be to all involved.
This could be accomplished in many ways, including through periodic quizzes about a brand mission, ideals, logos and more.
The more informed everyone is, the less chance someone wears their metaphorical jersey backwards.
4. Use software designed to ease the process
Probably the biggest problem brands face in terms of compliance and consistency throughout each project and campaign is a lack of version control.
Over 10,000 files get lost on company systems, and the important branding documents that are found end up disorganized, over 7,000 scrambled files to be exact.
All too often teams sharing materials interdepartmentally end up confusing one another and causing more harm than good. This is because it’s basically impossible, without an automated system, to make sure all employees use the latest version of a document at all times.
Without compliance software, brands often run into the following issues:
- Misplaced files and assets
- Unorganized files
- Version problems
However, this is only part of the equation. Another piece of the puzzle is having a system that stores brand materials in a centralized location to ensure easy access, which in turn promotes compliance.
Brands are implementing digital asset management (DAM) software to handle both of these potential issues. DAM efficiently manages all branding assets, ensuring each project uses the right elements.
DAM also centralizes branding materials for quick retrieval and guarantees version control, which are both crucial factors in staying compliant.
5. Examine your guidelines and communication materials
If you’ve followed the strategies listed above, there’s a good chance you don’t need to create a new set of branding guidelines. However, that doesn’t mean they have to be set in stone.
The last thing you want is inconsistencies across channels, especially since consistent branding increases revenue by an average of 25%.
Evaluate what’s working, then apply that to your assessment of the current guidelines. Make sure they offer the details on the right and wrong ways to handle different materials.
Next, consider the communication materials that audiences have access to. Are they drastically different? Similar? Do they comply with brand standards?
It doesn’t take long to answer these questions. Usually it’s pretty obvious when something is off. As long as you periodically evaluate these processes, staying compliant will be a real possibility.
You’re well on your way
Improving brand compliance is a smaller part of the overall branding process, but it has big implications.
Whatever these implications are, follow the necessary steps so they’re a positive for your brand.
Lastly, remember all the values and ideals you were excited to build your brand upon. These are what you’re fighting to uphold when aiming for stronger compliance.

62,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-consistency-across-channels/,"How media libraries help ensure brand consistency
October 25, 2017|
Strong brands command a premium. But to realize premium value, your brand must gain significant purchaser recognition to establish trust and speed purchase decisions. Purchaser recognition is premised on consistent portrayal of your brand – from brand story to brand personality to brand elements – across all company/consumer touchpoints. Without it, the harmony in your brand can quickly drift out of tune, or even collapse into cacophony.
Single source of truth
A leading tool to help ensure brand consistency across channels is a single source-of-truth media library like Canto. A media library is a system that can store, organize and share digital brand assets that your company needs to manage. These consist of the images, videos, color schemes, logos, presentations and collateral that form your brand’s core identity and visual style.
With such a media library, you can place all your brand assets into a portal for sharing across marketing teams or your entire company. Once supplied in an easy and accessible location, everybody knows where to go for brand identity materials, or the newest tweaks to your current campaign. This keeps everyone on the same page, and cuts down logo and image requests, because most people are more than happy to self-serve and reduce their wait times. It also helps avoid such outcomes as the employee who, short on time and patience, sends out a hacked-together version of your company’s logo, or uses an outdated template for media presentation.
Multichannel marketing
Broadcasting your message across a multitude of channels exponentially increases brand consistency challenges. It takes a pretty robust system to ensure that the right logos, graphics, offers (and even languages) appear in the right places at the right times, available to the right external stakeholders, partners and suppliers. The value of a media library really cannot be underestimated here. Just one partner misuse of a logo or image can disrupt a big campaign.
One way to leverage a media library against this risk is to set up external campaign portals by channel, country or region, and provide access rights only to those who need them. Your marketing team administrates and maintains oversight over the whole production, selectively limiting view and access by outside parties. This isn’t a complicated knot of permissions within nested folders. It’s just intuitive drag and drop, with fine-tuned controls as you need them (such as global or asset-level expiration dates). This takes work off you and delivers peace by mind as partners learn where to go for the assets they need to help your message march across broadcast, ad networks, digital and print collateral and/or in-store.
Social media marketing
One marketing channel that deserves special attention with regard to brand consistency is social media. This is where many companies can go astray, because they tend to let their hair down on social media, as imagery and tone becomes personalized to the person posting. If posted images and voice drift too far, your social media presence can disconnect from your core brand and create consumer confusion.
One sure way to keep social media in check is to use social media integrations within a media library. This allows social media marketers to augment their brand judgement with pre-approved imagery. How nice to inherently avoid the legal jeopardy that can occur from a social media marketer pulling an image down direct from google search, and posting it in the name of your company.
Copyright, usage restrictions and watermarks
Little appreciated among brand consistency tools are copyright and watermarking. Traditional file storage and google drive lack ready access to this kind of asset metadata. Yet with media libraries, teams can locate approved images relevant to their needs, while at the same time easily tracking their copyright and usage restrictions. A publicized dispute or adverse decision over wrongful use can quickly damage trust in your brand. Much better to know the boundaries of image use in the first place, and avoid risky guesses.
Last, the use of watermarks for images distributed to partners and suppliers can limit downstream brand consistency problems, by stopping print-ready and high res digital assets from going into inadvertent circulation. The brand consistency cost of tracking down just one asset mistakenly “let into the wild” can be substantial. No one wants a big campaign damaged by a premature message leak. Watermarking is a core feature of media libraries that can reduce this kind of risk.
Your brand is a trust
Your brand is a trust, and needs protection. Media libraries help ensure the integrity of your brand, so that you can reach new sales heights."

“Success isn’t always about greatness. It’s about consistency.” – Dwayne Johnson
Imagine for a moment that you’re attending a webinar hosted by your favorite design software company.
You’re expecting to see slides filled with beautiful designs, interesting fonts and creative layouts. Instead, the presentation lacks any unique creative elements, giving only a couple of dull slides without the brand colors or schemes.
This would leave you confused, wondering if the company lost its edge. It might also make you worried about the future of their product branding.
This story illustrates the problem with a lack of brand consistency. Clearly, a successful brand wouldn’t make such a mistake. Let’s make sure you don’t either.
This guide will go through everything you need to know about brand consistency. More importantly, you’ll learn how to go above and beyond the bare minimum.
What is brand consistency?
Brand consistency ensures campaign messaging adheres to brand values, visions and ideals. It presents your intended audience with advertisements and ideas that represent the true nature of your brand. These are usually in the form of logos and other important brand elements.
Roughly 99.9 percent of brands will make at least one type of brand consistency error at some point. In fact, you probably even recall a time where a successful brand had a uniformity failure.
Instead of being intimidated by this near-inevitability, use it as a chance to prepare. Recognize that at some point, your brand consistency efforts might falter.
If you minimize the amount of times it happens, it’s not as big of a deal. Remain consistent 99 percent of the time, and you’ll create a lot of room for success.
To help you out, I’ve come up with a list, my ‘Top 5 reasons to maintain brand consistency’.
Top 5 reasons to maintain brand consistency
Note that I titled the list the ‘Top’, rather than the ‘only’, reasons to maintain brand consistency. There are plenty more, and different reasons might even be on your personal top five.
For now though, these are the ones I want to put some focus on in this section. Let’s break each one down.
1. Builds and retains customer excitement
“A great brand is a story that’s never completely told.” – Scott Bedbury.
Experts often push the idea that brand consistency is supposed to be dull. In fact, they claim that the more mundane, the likelier it is your brand is consistent.
Now, this applies some of the time with things such as logos and color schemes. It’s not that your logo or layouts are dull in and of themselves, rather, it’s that in order to be consistent they need to stay the same through each project, which is quite tedious.
However, the end result of this tiring task and attention to detail is brand consistency, and that is the opposite of dull.
This is because the only way to truly deliver an exciting brand experience to customers is to build and maintain excitement over time using consistency.
2. Boosts credibility
The most consistent brand is typically the most credible brand. This needs some extra attention since brands extend their outreach further than only a few mediums now. Companies advertise on TV, in print formats, on the radio, in online videos and on social media.
The current trends indicate ad revenue is blossoming on digital platforms, so don’t expect this advertising pattern to change anytime soon.
Here’s an example that shows how brand consistency can uphold credibility. Imagine a company that sells outdoor goods, such as hiking gear, starts a Twitter and YouTube account.
At some point during their few years on Twitter, they are asked a question about how to set up a tent on a certain terrain. Unfortunately, they give a completely wrong and terrible answer.
Even if all the YouTube videos and Tweets they made up until then had been consistent with their outdoors brand, this single lack of consistency crushed a lot of their credibility.
3. Enhances and meets customer expectations
Each time I order something on Amazon, I fully expect the experience to be easy and straightforward (I can’t say I expect the same when I go to get my driver’s license renewed from the DMV!).We all have certain expectations that are formed by a company’s consistency (or lack thereof). If the next time I order from Amazon, I’m prompted with extra pop ups, unnecessary questions and confusing qualifiers, my expectations in the future will change.Brand consistency prevents this type of change from taking place.
4. Eases the marketing process
Imagine this scenario: One of the marketing teams for the soft drink company, Pepsi, is having a meeting. They’re thinking about how they’ll go about marketing their upcoming new product, P-8, an energy drink.
A few marketers suggest an extreme label for the can, indicating a fierce experience. Others suggest a label with ‘fast’ items on it, such as a race car or cheetah.
Another marketer believes putting an athlete on the label would be best, since the energy drink would be a performance enhancer.
Here’s a much better suggestion, fueled by the power of brand consistency: put the Pepsi logo on the label. It’s that simple. Your consistency through the years has created brand value that needs no introduction, as it were.
Next, let’s take a look at how consistency builds loyalty over time.
5. Creates customer loyalty
It’s easy to show brand loyalty to brands who practice consistency. Quick quiz for you. Pretend you’re planning on buying a new truck. You head to a website and see that they have three different types. Below are the logos:
Based on these logos alone, would you take a truck from 1, 2 or 3?
I know your answer before posing the question. Obviously you’ll go with 1 or 2 (Chevy and Ford), even if you don’t favor those brands of automobiles personally. The reason being is that they’re consistent. They provide at least a semblance of quality with each transaction, and this is over a long history.
Logo 3, no matter what they offer, no matter how cheap their truck is, just isn’t going to win your trust. This is a demonstration of customer loyalty as a result of brand consistency.
Even if company 3 had a truck that was better in every way than 1 or 2, no one is going to stray from their built-in loyalty. Keep that in mind.
Now that you have a good idea of the rewards you’ll get from maintaining brand consistency, it’s time to learn how to implement helpful strategies.
Top 3 brand consistency strategies
Note: the following strategies are not run-of-the-mill, cookie-cutter methods.
Brand consistency strategies
These will legitimately boost your efficiency and give you a lot of sway with your target audience, especially if carried out optimally. Let’s begin!
1. ‘Show, don’t tell’ applies to brand consistency. Follow it!
Let’s try an experiment to illustrate the idea of ‘show, don’t tell’. The following is a group of drawings that have absolutely no products or logos in them:
Based on these drawings alone, can you guess which brand they represent? I’m guessing that over 90 percent of you can. Immediately, in fact.
Is it because you’ve seen the exact commercial they took place in and remember it? Maybe, but probably not.
Rather, it’s more likely that you know that it is an advertisement for Red Bull because of the drawing style.
So how does ‘show, don’t tell’ apply here? Well, imagine seeing an advertisement similar to the above and knowing immediately what brand is being represented. This campaign didn’t need to jam their product and logo in your face to successfully promote their brand. It was just natural.
Does this mean a recognizable visual style is necessary to ‘show, don’t tell’ in your own campaign? Of course not. The key takeaway from the success of the Red Bull campaigns isn’t that their visual style is unique (though this is part of it). Instead, it’s that Red Bull uses this unique style consistently.
‘Show, don’t tell’ gives companies a chance to reap the benefits of consistency while making a unique campaign that shows why their product or service is best.
If your company’s laptops have been the sturdiest for twenty years, run an advertisement demonstrating it. Submerge your latest model underwater and show it still kicking. At the end of the day, it will be a lot more effective than simply pointing out in a text ad that your computers are sturdy.
When you show instead of tell, you’re able to maintain consistency without overwhelming your target audience with promotion.
2. Be flexible when you can. Hold steady when you need to. Never be flimsy.
“The measure of intelligence is the ability to change.” – Albert Einstein
Now, this may seem to go against the basic concept of consistency, but you need to be flexible when the situation calls for it. In fact, even if a bit of flexibility could detract from the brand identity you’ve built, it’s important for your brand regardless.
Here’s a situation where being flexible could come in handy. Imagine a retail company builds their brand by ensuring customers they will have the shortest lines of any grocery markets around. They accomplish this by restricting customers from exceeding three carts full of groceries.
Customers grow to love this concept and the company grows to be one of the most popular stores in the world.
One day, a woman with seven young children is shopping at this store. She’s a bit stressed out and is trying to control her kids while getting food they need for the week. She ends up filling three carts.
This is a time when being flexible won’t hurt your brand. Allowing her to go through as an exception won’t ruin everything you’ve built up until now. It will also give your brand a hint of compassion in the eyes of your customers.
In comparison, it’s equally important to be firm when you need to. Using the above example, being firm is what initially grew the brand. Whenever somebody got into a line with three full carts, they were told to step out and put some items back in order to complete their purchase.
Holding steady like this builds consistency and shows customers that your brand stays true to its ideals.
Finally, make sure to not be flimsy. In the context of our fictional grocery brand, being flimsy would entail occasionally allowing random customers to break the line rules with no good reason.
This flimsiness won’t earn any praise from customers, and eventually it will become clear that your brand isn’t consistent.
3. Just because you set it up, doesn’t mean they will knock it down. Prepare for this reality.
Here are a couple different situations showing that this principle is an important thing to understand:
a) Two young, motivated women start their own company on the idea that they could handle customer service for larger corporations. What sets them apart is they’re well-versed in dealing with potentially angry customers and know how to rectify numerous situations.
They name their company, “As nice as it gets”. After a few months of promotion, they land a couple jobs. Their performance is excellent, and eventually they’re offered full control over a large company’s customer service.
This meant that the owners would have to bring on some employees to help out with the now extra work. The trick would be finding people who were able to maintain the ‘As nice as it gets’ brand.
They had an idea. After finishing their hires, they would set everything up for each employee so that they would understand exactly how to behave on the phone or over email with customers.
They printed out sheets that gave advice on how to deal with certain problems and customers. After distributing the sheets and giving some detailed training, the women knew their employees were given all they needed in order to maintain brand consistency.
Everything was going smoothly the first day, with employees following the branding guide, adhering to the brand values of ‘As good as it gets’. Then a rebellious young hire strayed from the script and began mistreating customers, showing indifference and overall rudeness.
b) You’ve just finished a brand style guide that demonstrates the fonts, layouts, schemes, colors and logos that makeup your brand. Every employee has access to it, and you feel that this, as well as the meetings you’ve held concerning brand values and ideals, should be enough to ensure consistency.
Certainly, this gives all team members a chance to create projects and campaigns that fulfill your brand guidelines. However, you’re finding that a lot of newly published articles are lacking the right branding materials.
The team members are trying their best to follow the brand style guide with each piece they create, but for whatever reason they’re failing.
This could be cured with a simple process that implements some type of ‘before-release’ brand check. It’s fine to give team members the space and freedom to create without constant oversight, but make sure there is at least a brand safety net before each piece is released.
Sometimes the best way to ensure consistency in this situation is to make every team member consider how their creation ties in with the brand.
Situations ‘a’ and ‘b’ above are both common realities companies face when trying to stay brand consistent.
It’s way too easy for branding experts to tell you, “Make sure you have a clear brand style guide for all team members.” By now, everyone understands that concept.
However, what really matters is how employees handle these tasks. It’s important that you set the branding guidelines up, but don’t forget – ‘they’ won’t always knock them down!
Closing thoughts
There are plenty of branding articles, blog posts, videos and experts that suggest basic ways to maintain brand consistency. While it is important to get the basics down, this type of advice won’t pull your brand out of mediocrity.
Instead, extend your creativity and ideas past the normal. Think of ways to hammer down your consistency that others haven’t discovered yet. Chances are, you’ll find yourself on the right side of success. Good luck!

64,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-culture/,"3 keys to creating a positive brand culture
September 28, 2019|
Brand culture helps businesses succeed by providing a foundation to sustain and promote a company’s values and mission. Creating a brand culture takes time and effort, as well as cooperation from each department. Before you begin creating your own brand culture, it’s important you understand what it is.
What is brand culture?
Brand culture is the result of a company’s effort to deliver its core brand values in every project and interaction. It’s the culture created by a company to express its brand transparently. A brand culture includes the behavior of people who work for a particular brand.
Here are three key steps to take when creating brand culture:
1. Introduce brand
Create a powerful, unique brand as soon as possible. This is the foundation of your company’s entire brand culture. By laying out the building blocks of brand for all departments, team members will fall in line with company values and thrive to be a part of brand culture.
In order to create a memorable brand culture, create or re-evaluate your company’s values. It’s important that these parallel the brand. More importantly, they need to be something all team members adhere to. A brand culture requires everyone to buy into the values and vision of a company. It also requires efficient brand management to ensure these efforts are running smoothly.
2. Inspire brand-specific communication and collaboration
All communication and collaboration should reflect the company brand at all times. This includes times when communication is private or when it’s with externals. Furthermore, any updates to brand should be relayed to team members in a manner that encourages ongoing conversation. It should not be a one-way street.
When team members collaborate on a project, it’s important they do so while promoting brand to the best of their ability. This is a large part of a brand culture and it applies further than in-house projects. Any collaboration with externals should include positive brand communication.
3. Include brand from start to finish
Whether it’s the start of a project or the beginning of a team member’s time with the company, make sure brand culture is immediately introduced and imposed. This involves ensuring everyone knows and understands the company mission as well as the core values.
Part of accomplishing this might include a visual display of values inside a workspace. In a physical location this could mean a printout hanging from the wall in a frame. Digitally, it could be distributed in the form of a handbook for new team members. Finally, your current team members act as representatives for the brand culture you’ve built, with their words and actions.
Building a brand culture requires interdepartmental cooperation, consistent reminder of core values and extensive evaluation of brand. It’s a continuous effort and commitment that will positively impact your customers. Make sure the brand culture you’ve created is promoting your company’s core values and vision."

August 5, 2020|
Think different.
This advertising slogan, used by Apple, is representative of why brands succeed or fail. It doesn’t say think safe, same or normal – it says think different.
All too often, we play it safe, copying the competition. This is not how successful brands go about their marketing strategies.
It can be scary to branch out on your own, away from the norm. There’s risk involved, but this is risk successful brands accept wholeheartedly.
Brand differentiation is achieved when brands are willing to take a chance, ignore antiquated traditions or the status quo and risk it. It’s about finding new ways to excite customers about your brand and what it can do for them.
Brand differentiation has the potential to do the following for your brand:
- Increase brand loyalty and brand advocacy
- Help you stand out in areas other than pricing, products or services
- Boost your brand recognition
This article is your stepping stone to success. It offers a chance to differentiate your brand using unique methods most haven’t heard of.
What is brand differentiation?
Brand differentiation is when a particular brand stands out next to all of its competitors. If a brand tries to achieve brand differentiation, they’ll be attempting to contrast from others in a positive manner. The goal is to achieve greatness through contrast – not to be different arbitrarily.
Essentially, brand differentiation as a business term means that a brand has found a way to be different than their peers in a positive way.
Here are some key components that typically make up this type of differentiation:
- Experiences
- Stories
- Values
- Exclusivity
- Characteristics/mascots/personas
Throughout your business journey, you’ll find plenty of ways to stand out from competitors. The key is to recognize when to do it and how to go about things to find success.
Even if your brand has to emulate another, it should do so with the attempt of being better, rather than being the same.
Finally, remember that being contrarian doesn’t always lead to positive brand differentiation – keep it within reason.
Why differentiation is so valuable to innovative brands
Think of the world of business like an academic decathlon. If you’re competing, chances are there’s a category you favor – for this example we’ll say it’s math. When the time comes for the math section, you need to capitalize.
Similarly, if you’re an innovative brand with a creative idea, you have to capitalize when the ‘math’ section arises. Brand differentiation is your ‘math’ section; your time to shine.
The reality is, chances are the competition has the same solution you do for customers. For example, Apple and Samsung both offer a smartphone that is roughly identical to others on the market.
However, Apple and Samsung are crushing the competition when it comes to global smartphone sales. In 2019, seven out of ten phones on the top ten global shipments list were Samsung/Apple.
The iPhone XR shipped 26.9 million units globally, while the Galaxy A10 shipped 13.4 million (statistics courtesy Gizmochina). This begs the question, if other brands have identical phones, why aren’t they selling any of them?
The answer to that question, and the key to success, then, is innovation.
Let’s now take a look inward. In what ways can each brand find to stand out in their branding?
You might notice a similar issue between your brand and its competitors – both offer the same service or product or solution to customer problems. It’s going to boil down to differentiation.
7 dynamic processes to boost your brand differentiation
There are many ways to stand out, but they’re definitely not equal. Some, in fact, are detrimental. So how do you narrow your efforts to effective methods? Consider the following strategies:
1. Focus on the magic of brand experience
As you’ll see later in my examples, it’s pretty clear that most brands who have strong differentiation also offer strong experiences.
There are many different ways to go about giving a memorable experience. One such way happened unexpectedly in a public place, thanks to the branding of Volkswagen.
In a public subway station, they set up the stairs next to the escalator to resemble keys of a piano, which made noise when people stepped on them.
The fun the people had on the stairs spread to those who only got to watch online, making the campaign a success by promoting the ideals VW wished while making a brand memory for many.
Similarly, look for ways to create your own brand experience. This is a chance to get creative, because the possibilities truly are endless.
It doesn’t have to be an all-out, crazy event, either. Sometimes it’s as simple as a friendly smile on a product or the design of a building. Whatever it is, make sure it’s memorable.
2. Be exclusive without being exclusionary
There are a lot of strategies to make exclusivity work for your brand, from pricing, to luxury, to exclusion or clubs.
Take pricing, for example. Many brands have found ways to differentiate by raising their prices in relation to competitors. This can represent quality while standing out.
Next, consider the ways luxury gives an aura of exclusivity. This doesn’t always have to be associated with high prices.
“Luxury is attention to detail, originality, exclusivity and above all quality.” – Angelo Bonati
Sometimes the appearance of luxury illuminates exclusive emotions. Think about the way some products are packaged, for example.
Finally, sometimes the literal act of exclusion can help you stand out. Fast food companies notoriously limit special items arbitrarily, building hype.
A bar in New York City took this idea to new heights, placing a ‘secret’ entrance in their establishment, which is only accessible by phone in a tiny phone booth hidden away in the corner.
As you can see from the above examples, sometimes exclusivity doesn’t have to exclude at all to be successful.
3. Market uncustomarily, within reason
Using good judgment when differentiating prevents us from going overboard.
Unfortunately, many marketing campaigns don’t heed this warning, ending up with a strange advertisement that wasn’t memorable, or in some cases, was completely inappropriate.
Unfortunately there’s no definitive guideline to this concept. Your judgment will be tested, and hopefully, you make the right decision.
The idea is to be extreme without actually being extreme; turn heads without getting blocked from YouTube or television.
Laphroaig Whiskey went contrarian when they created a 3.5 hour advertisement on YouTube (3:34:00 to be exact).
Most branded video advertisements on YouTube clock in at about one minute, making this video longer by 21,300%. Talk about extreme marketing!
Think of your own unique ways to buck the norm, but keep it within reason.
4. Tell a tale that shows your true colors
A brand story details how a brand came to be, highlighting the determination it showed throughout its history. The most successful brands have a relatable story that is told in a unique and creative way.
So, why is a strong story so important? Consider that two identical brands become completely different when one has a story filled with rich history, struggle and triumph.
Also think about the ways audiences love to connect to stories. Storytelling is a large part of human history, bringing a wide range of people together in ways that other methods cannot.
Picture how much easier it is to identify with a brand when you hear their story and realize people who were involved in its creation are just like you.
Now, take this feeling and use it to build your own story to connect in similar ways to target markets.
A good brand story should:
- Highlight struggles and obstacles your brand faced
- Demonstrate your positive characteristics in some way
- Show you overcoming past obstacles
- Foreshadow how you’ll overcome future obstacles
A great example to check out is the Burt’s Bees chapstick brand, who tells a detailed, intimate story about Burt, the founder, directly on their website.
The reason this story is so effective is it’s extremely detailed, pulling back the curtain on his private life. There is no makeup artist or production team to spice up the story or pictures. It’s as if you’re looking at a personal scrapbook of Burt’s adventures.
Use this example to catapult the development of your story.
5. Look for ways to implement personification
Similar to the brand story, personification offers a chance to stand out, even when you’re selling the exact same product or service as competitors.
Consider ways to take a product or service you offer and give it human traits. The results are surprisingly effective, as audiences love to feel an emotional connection to brands.
M&M’s accomplished this with their marketing advertisements that cast their candy as living, breathing creatures who talked and told jokes.
They may not have the only bite-sized chocolate candies, but they certainly stand out thanks to the personification of their product.
6. Build and show your expertise
“People who have expertise just love to share it. That’s human nature.” – David Baldacci
If two different people are offering the exact same service, whoever shows more expertise will be the one you choose.
Similarly, when brands compete, customers like to choose the one with more experience.
Of course, part of accomplishing this is by being an actual expert in your field, which we assume you are as a brand offering a service or product. However, not everyone knows this fact, and you need to show them somehow.
To do this, consider the following methods:
- Guest-blogging. Guest-blogging is a great way to show expertise, as you’ll get to show a lot of readers your knowledge about a specific topic. Keep in mind this should be done in addition to your own branding blog.
- Reference other experts often. In your own content, be sure to reference other experts. Chances are this will make your content seem more authoritative.
- Use PR. Nothing beats a well-crafted story of your brand on the news or other media outlets. It often creates a feeling of genuine authenticity for your audience.
Finally, be on the lookout for new ways to show your authority and expertise.
7. Target a new, niche demographic
Believe it or not, you’re not tied to a demographic forever. Sometimes, a pivot, even if slight, can help a brand stand out.
This is also a way for smaller brands to combat larger, more popular brands, as they can win over a niche demographic instead of going head-to-head for larger markets.
For example, the wireless carrier T-Mobile conceded its uphill battle against juggernaut Verizon, instead rotating their efforts towards capturing the millennial market.
By switching their focus to gen Y, T-Mobile was able to get a larger piece of the pie, even though they were targeting a smaller section.
Now, this doesn’t mean that you have to be an underdog to go after a niche market. No matter the level of success a brand shows, there’s always the opportunity to expand a target audience.
The above strategies offer a real chance to stand out and create legitimate separation from competitors. That said, it’s often important to see the potential successes that come along with differentiation. Let’s take a look at brands who did it best.
Examples of brands who nailed differentiation
These brands made a splash with their unique marketing campaigns and revolutionary products and services. Use them as an example to differentiate on your own.
1. Beyond Meat
Meatless companies and products, despite having a hungry market (no pun intended), have never quite actualized mind blowing success. They’ve been stale, uninspired and unable to differentiate from each other to win the market over.
That all changed with Beyond Meat, thanks to innovative products and branding. Beyond’s products are now all over the globe, and they’re on the forefront of meatless brand success.
Their target market: People seeking meatless alternatives that offer similar taste and texture to meat.
How they differentiated: The most obvious way that Beyond Meat is in their branding, starting with their name. Beyond meat implies that the product is the next step in food consumption evolution.
Further, they noted the stagnated products other meatless brands were promoting, and innovated the idea to emulate meat in many ways, rather than to move away from it.
2. Planet Fitness
There are two types of people who go to the gym: those who love going and those who hate it. If you are one of the many who hate going to the gym, Planet Fitness decided to make it easier for you to love it.
The typical gym is filled with things that discourage newbies and people who took a lot of time away from working out. Planet Fitness turned all that on its head by excluding members who turn gym culture into an unpleasant ordeal.
Their target market: Gym-goers who wanted to exercise without feeling the guilt brought on by stares from over-enthusiastic weightlifters.
How they differentiated: Planet Fitness is famous for restricting certain gym member types (shirtless, muscley men grunting and being intimidating to others), while promoting the idea that their specific gym is a ‘judgement free zone’. We won’t even fault them for misspelling ‘judgment’, because who knows, maybe they were trying to stand out?
3. Red Bull
As the demand for energy drinks continues to increase, one thing remains the same: Red Bull is a popular option. There are many reasons for this, and continued differentiation is one of them.
Red Bull refuses to be just a beverage, pushing the envelope on what a brand can accomplish in terms of experiences. This, among other things, have helped it remain in a class of its own.
Their target market: People who want the taste of soda but with more caffeine.
How they differentiated: Red Bull has made lighthearted claims about its product’s efficacy (“Red Bull gives you wings”), held global events and even sponsored a space jump! Pretty impressive for an energy drink brand.
4. Oatly
The market for milk has changed, opening a world of possibilities for new creations, such as soy, rice, almond, etc. This list of dairy-free milks is now bigger, thanks to Oatly and their oat-based milk products.
Apart from creating a new way to enjoy milk without the need for cows, Oatly is working to help the environment with their drink. This bigger purpose is evident all throughout their marketing campaigns.
Their target market: People who want a dairy-free alternative to milk but haven’t enjoyed the options available, such as rice, soy and almond milk.
How they differentiated: Oatly used creative branding and marketing to attract a niche demographic, as well as a whole new product to separate from the pack. They’ve even expanded their oat formula to be used in ice cream.
5. Unmade
It’s been a bumpy ride for the world of fashion in the internet age. As clothing companies work to find new and effective ways to ship their products to customers, brands with creative solutions are coming out of the woodwork.
However, one such brand did something that no one else thought of: re-purpose unused clothing materials for custom orders.
Their target market: Initially, their market consisted of customers who wanted to purchase a custom piece of clothing from high-quality fashion labels. Now, they help retailers design and manufacture new clothing ideas.
How they differentiated: By finding purpose and value where there previously was none, Unmade stood out to a market that typically had fewer options in terms of creating and/or purchasing different clothing materials.
6. IKEA
Furniture stores, at least until recently, were chocked full of stereotypes that for whatever reason all seemed to be true from one place to the next.
Customers expected basically the exact same thing whenever they needed to purchase some furniture, and their experience matched these expectations every time. That was until IKEA started growing in popularity, and managed to revolutionize how people think of the industry.
Their target market: Customers who crave new and exciting brand experiences when they buy furniture.
How they differentiated: IKEA stands out by offering low-priced products that somehow look extremely high-quality. They also are more than a furniture shop (they sell food in-store).
They’ve essentially gamified their products, making it quite an experience to assemble, which has become iconic.
Lastly, IKEA differentiates by understanding that no two customers are ever alike. This is evident from their guide to different bedroom layouts, which helped people find personalized furniture based on how they sleep.
For example, if someone slept with a pet in their bed, such as a dog, the IKEA guide would detail the best bedroom setup for that particular customer.
7. Etsy
Upon first hearing about Etsy, it may seem like a strange idea as a company, since they functionally seemed like just another eBay or Amazon. However, it turns out there was quite a market for it, and they were able to capture a niche audience.
Etsy is similar to eBay or Amazon in that it connects buyers with sellers across the world, but it differs in the fact it is dedicated to promoting handmade items that aren’t found on other sites. Clearly, Etsy was doing something right, because Amazon eventually tried to enter the same market, creating a handmade section as well.
Their target market: People who had unique skills to make crafts that didn’t have a set place on a site like Amazon or eBay.
How they differentiated: By catering strictly to handmade crafts that customers wouldn’t find in stores anywhere or on other e-commerce sites. Etsy helped users find that very specific vintage handmade item they had been looking for all their lives.
Highlight what makes you great
Now that you have the above tools and strategies to stand out, it’s time to make things happen.
Somewhere out there, someone is looking for your brand – they just might not know it yet. Stand out in more ways than one to help them discover exactly what they need – you.

66,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-dilution/,"Brand dilution: How a successful new product can harm a brand
August 10, 2020|
“I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” – Thomas Edison
If you’ve ever been to a restaurant with a self-serve soda fountain, chances are that you’ve seen a child mix every flavor together into one cup.
Their parents either tell them to go dump it out, or let them drink it to suffer the consequences of the bad taste.
We’d like to think that these types of ideas are the result of merely adolescent imagination, but as we see all the time, brands are susceptible as well.
They all too often create something new that doesn’t sync well with their brand, and it ends up costing them in the long run, resulting in many of the following consequences:
- Diminished brand image
- Loss of authority
- Reduced loyalty and brand advocacy
These decisions and their resulting outcomes are called brand dilution, which is something you’ll want to avoid. This article will walk you through the pitfalls and give some solid examples to learn from.
What is brand dilution?
Brand dilution is when a brand stretches itself out too thin, resulting in inferior products or services that tarnish their name and image. Most typically, dilution occurs when a company enters new markets or industries that they don’t usually sell in.
Imagine if Microsoft made a ceiling fan, or Coca-Cola created and sold microwaves.
These are hyperbolic illustrations, but they show the importance of avoiding unnecessary extension.
When the brand becomes watered down, this leads to a loss of value.
You’ve probably known a few brands that seemed flawless until they went off-script with a new product or service.
Even if they corrected their mistake, chances are your opinion of them changed. Let’s go into further detail about how brand dilution occurs.
How does brand dilution happen?
Dilution happens when a company creates a new product that fails. However, a failed product doesn’t always result in a diminished brand.
For dilution to occur, there needs to have been a lack of disconnect between this new product and the parent company.
For example, going back to the Microsoft ceiling fan, if Microsoft had created a brand called ‘WindRush’ that focused solely on fans, there would be distance between the parent company (Microsoft) and this new brand/product (WindRush/ceiling fans).
That way, if the ceiling fans flop, WindRush can simply go out of business and Microsoft isn’t negatively affected.
Now, you might be wondering what the best ways to avoid watering down your brand are, which we’ll explain later on. But first, let’s look at nine examples of brand dilution to help demonstrate the concept further.
9 illustrative brand dilution examples
“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” – George Santayana
These nine examples of dilution will shed some light on the potential consequences of overusing and overextending your brand.
1. Amazon Fire Phone
The product: The Amazon Fire Phone, a smartphone with powerful hardware that lacked needed software and apps to be successful.
The result: Part of the success of Amazon is their ability to enter and succeed in new markets. They’ve crushed retail stores, become the ultimate platform for sellers and done quite well streaming TV and movies.
Amazon seemingly has defied the idea that a brand can weaken itself through overexpansion. However, as the Fire Phone showed, they can’t succeed in every market.
The Fire Phone was released at a time when Amazon was still expanding but was mostly known as an online marketplace for books, movies and electronics. Customers were a bit confused by their dive into the smartphone market, but it was short lived.
Though it temporarily dampened the progress Amazon was making, they fortunately gave up on the Fire Phone and regained focus.
Takeaway: Amazon has shown time and time again that it can succeed in new markets, but smartphones just wasn’t one of them.
The key takeaway here is to note their correction, which was to give up on the idea and return to what was working for them.
2. Harley Davidson Perfume
The product: The Harley Davidson Perfume really existed believe it or not. As a product, it pretty much stood for the opposite of the Harley values.
The result: No amount of financial success as a direct result of this perfume would have been worth it.
There is a culture of loyalty attached to Harley, and this product nearly shattered it with how out of touch it was.
When we consider the types of products Harley has made in addition to motorcycles, they’ve all stayed pretty close to what the culture was about: jackets, boots, helmets, etc.
Perfume just doesn’t belong, and doesn’t even speak to the potential capabilities of Harley (whereas something like helmets does, since they’re an accessory to riding).
Takeaway: I think this is my favorite on the entire list. It not only has the absurdity factor, but is also the funniest.
I personally believe the perfume looks cool, with packaging/bottling that has a rugged feel to it like other Harley products. That of course doesn’t matter in the slightest, because it’s not the point at all.
The thing to learn from this gaff is that sometimes dilution can lead to brand damage.
3. Cadbury’s Instant Potatoes
The product: Cadbury’s Smash Instant Mashed Potatoes, were a boxed mix that confused more than it helped.
The result: If I saw this product on shelves today, I would be tempted to buy it, as it might be a revolutionary new chocolate-flavored mashed potato mix.
Unfortunately, that’s not the case. It’s instead just a failed journey into a new market by Cadbury.
I’m sure most customers who saw the ads for this product were confused, thinking Cadbury was bought out or some other extreme line of thinking.
Takeaway: Dilution can sometimes lead to confusion. I would have to say that this one ranks pretty high when it comes to baffling customers.
Also, even though Cadbury wisely created a new brand (Smash) to distance the parent company name from the potato product, they still tied themselves to it by including their ‘Cadbury’ signature logo at the top of packaging.
4. Crystal Pepsi
The product: Crystal Pepsi, a transparent version of the normally brown Pepsi cola beverage.
The result: In terms of revenue, Crystal Pepsi exploded with sales. This stuff was flying off the shelves everywhere, especially after Pepsi ran an ad for it on the Super Bowl.
Once again, however, it’s important to point out the illusion of success that plagues brands when it comes to dilution.
Just because it seemed like a neat concept, and just because people wanted to try it, doesn’t make up for the fact it tarnished Pepsi a bit.
Fortunately, Pepsi scrapped it and went back to making their better-tasting, original cola product.
Takeaway: Popular brands have a lot more leeway when it comes to trying new things. However, these liberties should be taken with a grain of salt.
For Pepsi, because of how many people enjoy the main product, seeing a new color was exciting and worth trying. After that, the product was done, and the customers just wanted to drink the regular stuff again.
If it’s any consolation to Pepsi, the Coca-Cola executives panicked and quickly released a failed ‘clear’ product of their own.
5. Virgin Water Filtration System
The product: The Virgin Pure Home Water System, a water filtration machine that is somehow tied to different types of transportation.
The result: When I consider an airline for a flight, I prefer them to be experts solely in flying and air safety, rather than a wide variety of things.
The Virgin water filter takes away from Virgin’s image, tarnishing their name and making them look rather silly.
On paper, it seems reasonable that if an airline makes a water filter, it should be of high quality. However, consider the inverse: a brand who makes water filters also flies airplanes. It’s not so appealing.
Takeaway: Virgin Pure is still around, selling different water filtration systems. They openly admit that they’re part of Virgin, which seems to overextend themselves.
Their ‘success’ in selling these products only eats away at their authority.
6. Dr Pepper BBQ Sauce
The product: Dr Pepper BBQ Sauce, a bottle of cola-flavored marinade that is intended to bring the Dr Pepper flavor to meats.
The result: Remember when I pointed out that not all examples of dilution stemmed from failed products? This certainly qualifies.
Dr Pepper has seen success through all types of side projects like Diet Dr Pepper and other new flavors. However, BBQ sauce just doesn’t really fit in.
It does appear like some fans enjoy it, but the existence waters down the Dr Pepper name.
Takeaway: Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. Also, just because something is a ‘success’ in the short term, doesn’t make it a success in the bigger scheme of things.
Entering a new market to make a little extra revenue is great up until the point it spreads you too thin.
7. Coca-Cola Clothing
The product: A line of Coca-Cola clothing in the 1980s, which was basically a few shirts with the Coke logo and colors printed on the front.
The result: Coca-Cola is good at making delicious soda, but that is the extent of their expertise. The clothes line was abandoned pretty quickly after being released.
Today, the Coca-Cola website still sells clothes, but it has a much different feel to it than what they were trying to accomplish with their clothing line in the 80s.
This time around, they seem to understand that they’re simply a soda brand offering their logo on clothing, instead of a soda brand entering the fashion market.
Also, I doubt many customers have purchased a shirt like above, especially for $29.95 USD. I almost feel like this is an elaborate prank from Coke.
Takeaway: Selling merchandise would have been one thing, but trying to infiltrate the fashion market was another.
Instead, Coke would have benefited from trying new flavors of their drink (which they eventually did, successfully).
8. Apple Newton
The product: Apple Newton, the first PDA ever created, had futuristic, mind-blowing features, but ultimately failed.
The result: Once again, we have an amazing, revolutionary product. And, once again, it overextends the brand and lessens it.
The Newton truly was impressive and way ahead of its time. Sometimes, being ahead of your time is a bad thing. Apple just wasn’t ready to focus the necessary time on this product.
Takeaway: Most of our smartphones today resemble the Newton somewhat, so we owe it to Apple for taking this early leap of faith.
However, they probably felt like they leaped off a cliff rather than into a successful new market.
Had internet access been much more prevalent, the Newton might have been able to exist successfully next to the Mac.
9. Windows Phone
The product: Windows Phone from Microsoft, which burst into an oversaturated market and took focus away from Microsoft software development.
The result: Microsoft had to cut their losses with the phone project after a few years of building up their mobile teams and partnering with other mobile-focused brands.
Takeaway: We can’t always explain why a brand can successfully enter a new market with one product, while failing to do the same with another.
That seems to be the case for Microsoft and mobile phones, since they’ve successfully entered the video game world (Xbox) and tablet market (Surface) without tarnishing their name.
The Windows Phone couldn’t compete with Android and iPhone, but even if they could have, it still might have been a bad idea to try.
Bonus example: Michael Jordan playing baseball
The decision: Michael Jordan, arguably the best basketball player of all time, decided to retire from the sport in the prime of his career to play baseball instead.
The result: Michael Jordan is a global brand, and everything the player does, from movies to commercials, seems to add to its success.
However, playing baseball was quite the failure. Not only did Michael stink at the game (he failed to succeed even as a minor-leaguer), but it warped his brand completely, at least briefly.
We had become so accustomed to seeing Jordan win all the time that watching him fail was awkward. Luckily for the sake of his iconic brand, he returned to basketball.
Takeaway: We cannot do it all. Amazon learned this in our Fire Phone example, and Michael Jordan experienced this harsh realization when switching to baseball.
Seeing these examples helps us notice patterns that lead to a tarnished brand. Let’s explore this concept further with some helpful tools.
How to avoid brand dilution
Unfortunately, there are no guides or simple rules to follow to prevent brand dilution. Sometimes, it happens.
When it does, the best thing to do is cut your losses and go back to what made you great in the first place.
That being said, there are definitely some ways to increase your chances of avoiding it. Here are some tips to guide you:
Don’t change the underlying aspect of why consumers enjoy your products. Crystal Pepsi failed because the taste wasn’t as good as the original Pepsi cola, plain and simple.
Consider co-branding if seeking to enter new markets. It’s great that you want to win over a new market, but it’s pretty tough without some help. Think about partnering up to reduce some difficulty.
We can’t truly change who we are or what we’re really good at. Harley Davidson can’t sell perfumes, Amazon can’t make smartphones and Michael Jordan can’t hit home runs against pro pitchers. Don’t overcomplicate things or make life difficult.
To further guide you down this path, let’s take a look at a few examples of times a brand extended itself successfully.
3 examples of brand extension that worked
“Determine who you are and what your brand is, and what you’re not. The rest of it is just a lot of noise.” – Geoffrey Zakarian
As discouraging as the above examples are, they aren’t indicative of every extension attempt.
Though it certainly is difficult to expand about a brand, the numbers are promising enough to try, given the potential rewards.
Now that we’ve gotten plenty of ideas about what not to do, let’s check out the brands who did it right.
1. Rice Krispies Treats
The product: Rice Krispies Treats, a marshmallow bar made using Rice Krispies cereal.
Why it worked: Instead of trying something drastic (Rice Krispies steak sauce, etc), this idea made a lot of practical sense.
Since the cereal is normally not too sweet, adding the marshmallows to hold everything together wasn’t overwhelming.
The takeaway: Think of ways your current products or services might be changed in a unique way that could benefit you.
2. Apple iPod
The product: iPod popularized and normalized mp3 players and moved consumers away from traditional formats like CDs and cassette tapes.
Why it worked: Because it utilized Apple’s expertise, hooking up to a computer to import songs, they were able to create something special.
In terms of success, it thrived due to Apple’s superior marketing compared to competing mp3 players.
The takeaway: Apple didn’t stray too far from their talents when joining the mp3 craze. Consider how you might enter a new market with a product that syncs with your current talents.
3. Taco Bell Taco Sauce
The product: An individual bottle of the Taco Bell taco sauce for sale, which offered customers a chance to bring the taste of the fast food restaurant to their own cooking.
Why it worked: Taco Bell released their taco sauce in bottles and mix-packets to grocery stores for purchase.
This didn’t weaken the brand at all, since they were essentially offering the same product they were known for, just in a different avenue.
The takeaway: Brands can get creative and extend themselves without ruining their image. Taco Bell harnessed their creativity without going extreme.
Take into account the patterns of the above examples. Compare the successful decisions with the failures to ensure you don’t repeat the same mistakes.
Final thoughts
Wrapping things up, check out our branding guide if you want a comprehensive look at these processes.
Invariably, someone out there will have a seemingly transcendent idea for something new.
On some occasions, these ideas end up actualizing into something successful.
More often than not, they overextend.
Just remember: your brand name and brand image are more important than a gimmick that pulls in some extra revenue.
Think long term.
Think brand."
67,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-equity-vs-brand-value/,"Brand equity vs brand value: What’s the difference?
October 12, 2020|
It’s easy to get lost in the plethora of branding terms we hear routinely. Brand equity and brand value are two of the most common to confuse, since they’re so similar.
Fortunately, it’s pretty easy to tell them apart once the differences are laid out in a simple fashion.
This article will do exactly that, separating the two terms for you and making it simple to remember the difference between them in the future.
What is brand equity?
Brand equity is the significance a brand has according to a customer’s perceptions. It is an informed estimation of how much a brand is worth, though the criteria are typically intangible and difficult to measure. Brand equity also changes perceptions of brand value.
“A great brand is a promise, a compact with a customer about quality, reliability, innovation, and even community. And while the concept of brand is intangible, brand equity is far from it.” – Stephen B. Shepard
Brand equity is related directly to how well customers trust a specific brand, among other customer-driven perceptions.
It is the demonstrable value a company receives from putting a discernible brand name onto a product. This value is dictated by customer perception of an individual brand.
What is brand value?
Brand value is how much the brand is worth in financial terms. This is calculated through the market and answers the question: how much would it cost to purchase the brand? The answer depends on different, controllable factors that change periodically.
Brand value, at its core, is a data-driven measurement of a brand’s financial worth. It makes sense, then, that thorough market analysis in research helps someone determine a brand’s value.
As stated above, it is partially answering the question of how much it would cost to purchase the brand, combined with the even more important issue of how much would someone pay to purchase it.
A brand’s value is also directly affected by how much its competitors are worth.
The main differences between brand equity and value
The easiest way to differentiate between the two is to remember that the brand value is a more verifiable, measurable worth. Think of brand value as the monetary version of the two terms. Brand equity, then, is the more abstract of the two, as it is influenced more by the perceptions customers have about a brand.
Another way to think of these concepts is in terms of their overlap. For example, up until a few decades ago, the idea that a brand was an asset that altered performance was lesser-known and not an accepted concept.
How does this overlap the two terms? As the brand equity changes, this in turn shifts the brand value perceptions. At its most basic meaning, it influences strategies that boost the prolonged brand value.
Now that you have a good understanding of the differences between the two terms, let’s take a look at how to build them up.
How to build brand equity
It would be unusual to hear someone say they’re focused on building up brand equity.
Though it’s definitely possible to accomplish, you don’t usually go from point A to point B to do so. Instead, you start at point A, go to B and C, then end up at D.
So, what are our points B and C? Though there are sometimes more than a few, I’ll focus on these main ones in this article.
1. Make customers aware of your brand quality through association
Brand association links positive attributes to your brand in the mind of customers. In turn, these positive attributes make customers believe your brand is of a higher quality.
The most effective ways to directly influence brand association are the following:
- Through consistent messaging and language. Brand associations are created and maintained by how well a brand uses the right tone and vocabulary throughout its marketing campaigns. Make sure customers associate your brand with the right tone.
- Through personification. Never underestimate the power personification has in building association by bringing something inanimate to life. For brands, this usually comes in the form of a product, but there are plenty of opportunities – stay on the lookout for yours.
- Through extensive branding visuals. Probably the most memorable part of a brand are its visual elements, which fuel new associations. Your best bet with visuals is to place them somewhere that creates nostalgic thoughts and ideas.
2. Create lifelong customers through loyalty strategies
Before we go into the ‘how’, let’s address the ‘why’, as in, why does brand loyalty increase brand equity?
It does so in different ways, many of which are quite simple. For example, loyalty makes it easier to enter new markets, outduel competitors and find new customers through advocacy.
It also helps lower costs of future marketing campaigns, since the need for them is lowered, at least in terms of quantity.
Now, let’s dive into how to create lifelong customers through loyalty strategies. The following are proven methods:
- Focus on the customer. It seems obvious but that doesn’t mean it’s always practiced. Customer experience is one of the main driving factors in building brand loyalty, so work to create the strongest customer service on the market.
- Create a reward program. Reward programs are often overlooked and underrated in their efficacy. It turns out that the modern customer loves them and chooses to continue with a brand over the rewards they receive from a loyalty program.
- Build brand experience. It’s hard not to be loyal to a brand when they’ve created a memorable experience for you. Experiences that we hold dear for years are likely to push us toward the brand that provided them, time and time again. It’s like Walt Disney famously said, “Do what you do so well that they will want to see it again and bring their friends.“
The above factors are likely to indirectly improve your brand equity in the long run. Now let’s shift to building brand value.
How to build brand value
Building brand value is all about undergoing a comprehensive outline of strategies that all lead toward the same goal.
Similar to building brand equity, there are plenty of different tactics that may work. However, we’ll be going over the main few that I find most valuable.
Prioritize user experience
Not many things are more valuable than a brand that puts forth user experiences that are without frustration. Think of the ways your brand could optimize user experience.
One noticeable way is through a brand website. Though I won’t go into extensive details here, keep in mind that things like webpage speed, links, images and layout would vastly improve the user experience in this regard.
Extend your research efforts
Chances are, the amount of research you’re putting into finding important things out about the competition isn’t enough. Instead of accepting your research efforts as good enough, supercharge them to give yourself the best chance to succeed.
You’ll likely start to notice things that drive your creativity and spark new exciting ideas for different projects.
Pursue brand differentiation
Pursuing brand differentiation requires brands to step out of their comfort zone and buck the status quo – taking aim at the mundane practices of their main competition.
Though there are always new ideas sprouting up to build brand differentiation, the following are quite helpful:
- Find new customers to market to
- Emphasize your expertise
- Stand out by being exclusive
- Get creative with your marketing efforts
- Focus on brand storytelling
Most of what brings value separation to brands is creative thought processes and innovative efforts.
Work toward brand consistency
The main focus with building brand consistency should be keeping an eye on the core values and ideals of the brand.
If at any point campaign messaging veers off this path, correct it as soon as it has been spotted. The more this is monitored, the better your brand consistency will be.
Note that consistency doesn’t entail you can’t make creative changes, but instead it ensures you remain true to the values you put forth.
Now that you have an idea of how to build up brand equity and value, let’s discuss some potential future scenarios you’ll come upon concerning the terms.
Future considerations
Brand equity has a heavy influence on all things marketing and business methodology. Similarly, for it to function optimally, it needs to be researched and learned at the highest level. It’s extremely important that it is related to brand value.
This article demonstrated how to compare and differentiate between the two concepts of equity and value, but now let’s consider some other variables further. First, we know there are indeed ways to build strong brand equity, but don’t forget that they’re case-specific.
Also, as we like to follow trends to pinpoint things that work, don’t overlook customer service, as it seems to hold up as a top influence each time brands do research on building brand equity.
Brand value, on the other hand, can be changed and added to in many different ways. Similar to equity, these will vary from brand to brand.
One thing that could drastically impact the future outlook of building brand value is the tech that continues to develop for communication. Stay informed about new communication tech, since it’s a driving force behind team unity and increases project success.
Closing thoughts
There’s no substitute for knowledge and understanding.
Hopefully, this article gave you everything you need in order to have a basic idea of brand equity vs brand value.
With a more nuanced understanding of these related concepts, you can be more intentional about how your brand strategy comes together – and build both equity and value over time.

68,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-equity/,"Building better brand equity: The strategies and ideas you haven’t heard
September 1, 2020|
It’s common to assume that if a product is of high quality, it will sell, and if it’s of low quality, it won’t.
That’s just not how it works, though. In fact, products that are objectively better (higher quality, more durable, etc.) than others often fail while inferior products succeed.
Why is that? It all boils down to one thing: brand equity. It could mean the difference between a customer buying your product or picking another.
Sounds pretty important, right? Let’s make sure you do everything in your power to realize the full potential of your brand.
What is brand equity?
Brand equity is directly related to how well customers trust a certain brand. Brand equity is a demonstrable value a company gets when putting a discernible brand name on a product. This value is swayed by consumer perception of a specific brand.
Brand equity is made up of a combination of elements, including customer perception and the value this perception brings with it. It makes sense, then, that a customer’s positive thoughts about a brand turn into direct benefits.
Which leads us into the reasons why a strong brand equity is so important.
Discover the many reasons why brand equity is important
There are numerous different ways brand equity is valuable. Here are three reasons that I feel best show why you need to strengthen and maintain equity.
1. Creates greater expansion possibilities
Brand equity adheres to the idea that the ‘rich get richer’, in the sense that once it rises, a brand expands their operations into new markets successfully.
The concept is simple: good brand equity makes it easier and cheaper to sell products. As such, a new line of products won’t take as much advertisement, research or promotion.
This has a direct correlation with the potential for expansion. If a company wants to expand into a new market, it will be a lot easier if their brand is of the highest quality.
The example I love to use for this is Apple. They’ve been successful with almost each new market they’ve tapped into – music, jewelry, television, etc.
Imagine that Apple decided to make a new line of workout gear. Even though it would be aimed at a new target market, there would be serious carryover thanks to the brand equity Apple has built up.
Potential customers would expect an innovative line of clothing from Apple, making it a lot easier and less of a risk.
2. Positively affects pricing potential
“Pricing is the final representation of your work.”
If a customer thinks the price of a product or service is reasonable, they may make a purchase. This is a fair statement to make.
However, brand equity turns the idea of a ‘fair’ price on its head. Similar products, no matter how equal in quality, are often priced differently.
The main factor in these more expensive products is the brand behind them. A good example of this in action is at the grocery market, where name-brand products go for sometimes twice the price of a generic offering, despite being the exact same thing.
This tells us that the higher we build our equity, the more reasonable it is to price our products and services at a premium. This in turn also increases revenue.
3. Boosts customer retention
“All of your customers are partners in your mission.” – Shep Hyken
Brand equity has a direct effect on customer retention, which in turn makes it cheaper to market different products and services (since sales will be made based on the brand anyway).
Harley Davidson, for example, sells luxury motorcycles. However, it’s a general truth that their customers purchase more than a motorcycle from the company.
They also buy any new parts, gear and apparel. On top of this, when they need to upgrade their bike, they go through Harley Davidson as well. Many customers even seek out and discover information about new products Harley comes out with.
It’s fair to say that Harley’s customers are extremely loyal. This brand loyalty means the customers don’t need some kind of expensive marketing advertisements to bring their current customers back. There is no more convincing that needs to be done.
This type of retention is truly powerful and speaks to the importance of brand equity.
With these benefits in mind, I’ll next move on to some of the unique ways to increase and strengthen your brand equity.
Unique, dynamic strategies to boost brand equity
Now comes the fun part: building up your brand equity. I’m going to provide a simple approach to bolster your own equity.
This should help get the creative juices flowing, and you’ll soon be visualizing your own brand in each of these processes.
These strategies will show you the possibilities of all the helpful tools working in unison and make it simple to imagine how you would fit into them.
Discover your audience. Build awareness.
“Who are you? (Who am I?)” – Elvis Presley
Though he was referencing something completely different, Elvis was actually asking the right question here for anyone looking to increase brand equity.
Brands reflecting on their identity are doing the right thing, but they’re missing out on such a huge part of this step – discovering their target market.
Creating awareness is all about being noticed by distinguishing yourself as something unique and positive. So, how do we go about doing this? We first need a deeper understanding of our audience.
This entails more than simply knowing your key audience demographics. It requires a comprehensive understanding that includes details such as their perception of your brand, how they arrive at purchasing decisions and how they enter into purchasing processes.
Once you’ve gathered this important information, it’s time to take action! Consider your overall brand image with this specific market group and decide if you should make adjustments.
Next, determine what needs to be changed: Your messaging? The product they’re thinking of buying?
These reflections and consequent adjustments are sure to get you onto the right track, and propel you into the next part of the process: improving upon your current product or service.
Consider customer perceptions and expectations. Adjust products or services accordingly
This part of the process boils down to how customers feel about your brand and what they expect from it. Be willing to make changes based on these expectations.
The customer is going to compare and contrast brands (yours with competitors’). They’ll also consider how useful the product your selling is to their specific needs. Finally, how much they trust you is a huge factor here as well.
So, how can we make positive adjustments based on our potential target market? Addressing all possible concerns before acting is key. I’ll break it down into two separate sections, customer perception of your brand and how it affects customers.
Customer expectations based on perceptions
First, consider the level of separation (even if only the perceived level of separation) your product or services have from your direct competitors. This is a factor of brand differentiation.
Next, examine your trustworthiness, authority and reliability. Then, measure how well you’ve marketed your product as something that meets the audience’s needs.
Finally, consider the character, excellence and quality your product displays.
With these considerations in mind, you’ll be able to make a powerful adjustment that boosts each one. Aim to create differentiation between you and competitors, increase your authority, focus your brand to meet customer needs and boost the quality of your product.
This addresses a large part of customer expectations, but now you need to focus on their internal expectations.
Customer expectations based on internal sentiment
When someone sees your product, they react to their perceptions listed above (you vs competition, brand authority, how you meet their needs, product quality). They’re also swayed by how well your brand sparks different emotions.
This is a lot harder to influence than their other perceptions, since it’s about their internal feelings, but it is possible. If your target audience wants peace of mind, create marketing strategies that calm their nerves. If they want safety, keep them safe, so to speak.
The next part of the process deals more with the effectiveness of the product and your image.
Delivering product efficiency and brand values consistently
Brand values represent the kinds of things you stand for. When building brand equity, consider how these values meet customer needs beyond a product or service.
There are two different ways to accomplish this. The first is through the service or product directly. For example, if you’re committed to keeping the environment healthy, a new product line that doesn’t use any eco-dangerous materials helps relay this value.
Another way to do this is through types of marketing and messaging. Using the above example, this could be done through an environment-friendly slogan.
Next, it’s time to tackle product efficiency, or how your product is able to meet the unique and specific needs of the target market.
Many different factors enter into this, including things like product longevity, style, pricing and more.
It’s easy to say that your product should meet all these factors. In fact, I’m sure most companies do. However, a more focused approach is needed.
By first identifying your specific customer’s needs, you can focus on improving product effectiveness in those areas.
Finally, the last part of this process that brings everything together is building a meaningful relationship with customers.
Creating and maintaining meaningful customer relationships
The final phase of this process is the concept of building relationships so that our customers feel deeply connected to us.
This goes far beyond simply a conversation or a repeat sale, though these are included. Also included are the feelings customers attribute to purchasing your brand, the feeling of involvement and social connection they link to you and their overall commitment to it, even when not making a purchase.
In order to create and maintain meaningful customer relationships, we need to look for ways to encourage them further in the areas they care about.
So for example, connecting with audiences on social media or other forums boosts their involvement. Incentivizing different purchases could encourage a repeat sale. Adding something special to a purchase could make it feel more unique.
In fact, when a customer is able to freely connect with a brand on social media, it raises the likelihood of them re-purchasing items by about 30%. Offering rewards, gamifying sales and extending other perks increases the chances of a repeat purchase by nearly 40%.
Think about the ways you could push for these relationship-boosting ideas.
Brand equity-building recap
In order to build your brand equity, it helps to:
1. Identify your audience and boost awareness
2. Adjust products based on customer perceptions
3. Maintain product efficiency and values
4. Boost customer relationships
You’re now ready to start increasing your equity. But how do you know if it’s strong or not? It seems rather abstract sometimes. Fortunately, I’ve tackled this issue in the next section.
How to evaluate your current brand equity
“We should always be ready to explore our positive and negative traits by evaluating our real self from time to time.” – Dr. Prem Jagyasi
Before we dive into the ‘how’, we first need to understand the ‘what’ we are evaluating here. There are competing ideas on how to determine brand equity. The best way going forward is to combine these processes into a comprehensive strategy.
First, there are methods like brand awareness that are more abstract. This contrasts with the concrete method of evaluating the financial value of the brand.
So, in order to strongly and sufficiently evaluate our brand equity, we’ll combine these unique methods and come up with conclusions for each.
1. Determine your brand awareness
Brand awareness is how someone reacts or internalizes emotions when they experience a brand element. This includes things such as logos, styles, color schemes and jingles.
Brand awareness is essentially how popular your brand is. This popularity gives you a good example.
The most direct method to measuring brand awareness is by measuring searches to see data about how a brand is performing. This process is typically supplemented by software systems like Ahrefs.
Though this is the most direct way, there are a few others with similar but unique value. These evaluation methods also require some estimation and aren’t always 100% accurate, but they’re still valid and widely-used.
The first method is through determining customer perception of your product. Do they have a clear understanding of it, including all its lesser-known functions and/or features? Are they generally satisfied with everything it offers?
Understanding the answer to these questions is key.
The second method involves exploring customer emotions about your product. Did they have a strong emotional reaction while they used your service? Did the purchasing process make them happy? Stressed? Frustrated?
If you’re able to research all three of the above evaluation methods, it will become pretty clear how strong or weak your brand awareness is.
2. Consider how well your brand does vs competitors
This evaluation phase explores the ultimate power your brand has to win over your customers purchasing power.
Essentially, you’re attempting to determine the customer inclination to select your brand. There are quite a few ways to measure this, as well.
The first is to evaluate the extent of your outreach overall. That is, how well does it connect with its intended audience and deliver the value it promises.
Most of this is decided based on convenience and availability. For example, it’s not hard to find an Apple store globally. Even if there isn’t one in your area, there are certainly Apple products inside other stores, markets and malls.
Next, look at how well you implement a unique selling proposition (USP). This is the ultimate way to differentiate from the competition.
A USP validates whether or not your product or service belongs within its current market. It gives reasons why a brand is different from competitors, expresses innovative capabilities, durability, value and more.
An example of a strong USP is from the American brand Death Wish Coffee. Their USP asserts that they are the “World’s strongest coffee”.
Partnered with the name, it’s clear that any potential buyer realizes the type of differences they’re getting when they buy a batch (highly-caffeinated!).
3. Learn the overall financial value of the brand
Finally, we come to our most direct, data-driven way to evaluate brand equity, and that is through the overall financial value it retains.
This is calculated based on a brand’s price premiums, revenue, scalability and more. A combination of these factors give companies a detailed appraisal of brand value and equity.
For anyone interested in numbers, this way of calculating brand equity will certainly feel the most comfortable. It is a concrete method, that when partnered with the other two methods, results in a strong understanding of overall equity.
Start increasing your brand equity
Putting out a great product or service is only half the battle. Though it’s important to create quality services, customer perception of your brand is just as valuable. Follow these important methods to keep your brand equity strong.
Remember that target audiences make quick decisions – keep your brand equity high so that they pick you.

69,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-experience/,"1000s of brands fail to engage their customers – see how powerful brand experience prevents this
September 9, 2020|
There are a few special moments in our lives that we cherish – they stick with us forever and are easy to recall.
Some of these memorable events are often an experience we had with a brand. Whether it was hugging Mickey at DisneyWorld or seeing an act at Cirque du Soleil, these brands are tied to us forever.
There are many different types of brand experiences that influence how audiences view a brand. Whether it’s emotional connections in content, targeted ads or promotions, the overall goal is the same: make a positive impact on the audience’s feelings.
What is brand experience?
Brand experience influences how customers feel about a brand through a simple but meaningful encounter. Brand experience builds consumer awareness and often creates brand-faithful customers. The ultimate goal is to elicit positive emotions and feelings from consumers concerning a specific brand.
This means that customers are directly influenced by all types of different experiences they have with different brands.
Knowing this, it stands to reason that you should work to create better experiences for customers.
Why is brand experience so important?
“The customer experience is the next competitive battleground.” – Jerry Gregoire
If your brand experience is dull and underdeveloped, audiences won’t engage. It really is that simple.
The following are two different company’s newsletter signup suggestions. It’s abundantly clear that one stands out more:
Sign up here to get our newsletter completely free.
Compared to:
We offer rewards based on your involvement. Earn points to get fantastic rewards. To start off with a free 50 points right away, sign up for our newsletter.
The second brand, which chose to gamify their newsletter signup, offers much more of an experience. Don’t think of these offerings as bribes. Rather, as a way to give audiences more.
If customers already like your product, that’s great. They may sign up for your newsletter no matter how you present the signup. The difference is, one signup comes with the chance to change brand perception.
This is just one case that shows how important it is to provide a unique experience. I will give you plenty of dynamic ideas to create amazing, memorable experiences. But first, let’s take a look at some successful brand experience examples.
3 brand experience examples to consider
The following examples are a great way to understand how brands have historically been successful in providing customer experiences.
1. Lego
Lego innovated a great experience for customers before, during and after purchases. It accomplished this through touch points that evoked thoughts, feelings and behaviors.
Audiences experience the Lego brand hands-on without making a sale. Case in point, Lego shops and Legoland destinations offer free products and events. The company also creates movies, video games and virtual reality.
2. Red Bull
Red Bull is vastly popular, having been around for decades in a relatively new market (energy drinks). It has created unique brand experiences by holding sponsored events for sports and extreme physical feats.
From things like motorbikes, car races, marathons and skydiving, Red Bull events are sure to have the extreme fix customers crave when they drink a caffeine-filled beverage.
Most noticeably, a Red Bull-sponsored space jump ended up breaking the sound barrier and giving everyone who tuned into the live stream – all eight million of them – quite the memorable experience.
3. Netflix
Netflix has fairly limited options to create a memorable brand experience. Whereas a movie theater can have premieres with costumes, celebrities and special events, Netflix instead streams directly to customers’ houses.
However, that didn’t stop them from creating memorable experiences for fans of popular shows they revitalized.
The first show was ‘Arrested Development’, in which the streaming giant held an event at a banana stand, where fans could visit and learn more about the upcoming episodes.
The next show was ‘Gilmore Girls’, a fan favorite which had been off the air for a while. Netflix had a return event upcoming, so they remodeled hundreds of coffee shops exactly like Luke’s Diner from the show. This created a lot of buzz and memorable moments for fans.
These examples give us a pretty good jumping off point for building our own brand experiences.
Now it’s time to come up with our own ways to make products evoke positive emotions. Here are some strategies to guide you along the way.
Strategies to boost brand experience
Your audience is human. Give them a human experience!
“Nothing revives the past so completely as a smell that was once associated with it.” – Vladimir Nabokov
The good thing about knowing your audience is you can tailor projects and campaigns to meet their needs. Fortunately, you know that the audience is human, so you’re able to target their senses. A sensory response makes an experience much more memorable.
Now, everyone reacts to specific senses differently. Some have strong reactions to smells, while others prefer taste. Luckily, you’ll be able to elicit a general range of senses and never be too far off (unless Haley Joel Osment is one of your target audience).
So, how do we go about targeting the audience’s senses? This depends on your specific brand. You’re not limited by it, but it does play a factor in which between smell, taste, hearing, etc. you target.
If you’ve ever been to an Apple store, it’s clear that each one was designed to form a sensory attachment to the customer experience. They have modern, clean, simple, painted-white walls with a wide open space and are visible from the outside-in.
Clearly, they wanted to appeal to the aesthetic so that audiences would think of them as a visually stunning sight to see.
Conversely, if a massage-chain had loud heavy metal music played in all of their stores, customers would get the wrong feelings associated with their brand. Remember, there is such a thing as eliciting the wrong senses, and it leads to negative brand association.
Every brand personalizes experiences. Take it a step further.
“Personalization is pointless without knowing the individual. Understand the dreams, hopes, and fears that motivate your customers, then hit them where it counts.” – Paul Gillin.
By now, every brand strives to personalize customer experiences. Quite simply, it has shown to be an effective strategy. Therefore, personalization has become the new standard, a bare minimum if you will.
As a result, you’re going to have to create brand experiences that are personalized beyond the norm. Depending on your brand, this personalization will differ.
If, for example, a real estate brand suggests ten different houses based on the fact you like light blue, but some of them are out of your price range, they’ve only delivered a half-personalized experience.
Clearly, in order to succeed, at least in the above scenario, you would need to dive deeper into the realm of personalization and suggest light-blue houses within the correct price range.
So, What are some ways we can go about doing this? Realistically, the solution is technology-driven and data-driven. We’d like to think it would be possible to create personalized brand experiences without modern tech tools, but it’s just not practical anymore, especially on a large scale.
There are so many different solutions designed to benefit specific brands, so do some extensive research to make sure your brand is using the right tools, like branding software, to help personalize your next campaign.
There’s a difference between creating emotional content and creating emotion-evoking content. Make sure you do the latter.
In 2018, Lexus released a television advertisement that was written entirely by an artificial intelligence machine. In it, a man designs and builds a car then sends it off to get tested for safety.
The machine responsible for the script compiled data about successful videos and determined they all elicited emotional responses. Therefore, it tried to jam (I use this word very intentionally) emotion into its car commercial.
Shown below, the man is nearly crying as he watches his car drive away to the testing site. This will be tough to resonate an emotional response from human audiences, as they don’t get choked up over cars.
This was a clear example of creating emotional content. Having emotional representations stuffed into a branding campaign is different than evoking emotions.
Making content that elicits emotions clearly takes a bit of finesse and subtly, rather than a ham-fisted approach.
The best advice I can give, then, is to be authentic. Audiences pick up on dishonesty right away. You can’t manipulate emotions with slimy, shady content. This type of content is already over-saturing the current market.
Instead, work on ways to connect with your audience on a deeper level. Focus on them and their real experiences. Only then can an emotional connection begin to take place.
Typical brand experience obstacles and how to overcome them
Surprisingly, some of the biggest obstacles to optimizing experiences come internally within each brand.
Roughly ⅘ of marketers understand the power of brand experience, but less than ⅔ of them believe their specific brand is delivering a strong experience.
Similarly, about ⅔ of team members believe their superiors don’t place emphasis on brand experience the same way they do.
This leads to a disconnect within teams, and eventually, campaigns. The solution is an emphasis and/or re-evaluation of your branding strategy. This gives a firmer structure of goals and a deeper emphasis on the overall brand.
The future of brand experience
The reality is that no one can successfully predict the future. What is trending today may be dead tomorrow.
However, that doesn’t mean to simply let the pieces fall where they may. Part of the branding game is the idea that everything will at some point change. It’s not our job to pinpoint that change in advance, but instead to be prepared as much as possible to react when it does.
That being said, educated speculation is an important asset in preparing for the future of brand experience. The current trajectory appears to be one in which everyone wants personalized and authentic experiences.
Prepare for this to be relevant in the near future, but also prepare for the possibility of a totally different landscape.
Final thoughts
Remember, even though you can’t control customers or prospects, it is possible to influence their perception. This gives you more power than you think. Make sure to use this important leverage to your advantage.
Finally, evaluate the way audiences experience your brand from time to time. Chances are their perceptions will change – be ready to adapt when they do.

70,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-extensions/,"Venturing into the land of brand extensions: A comprehensive look into key examples
December 31, 2020|
When something is impossible to ignore, it either succeeds dramatically or fails miserably – there is no middle ground.
That is why brand extensions either have long periods of success or immediate, mind blowing failures.
This article offers seven unique brand extensions that worked, and a few that failed, along with explanations to why they succeeded or not. Let’s make sure your extension flies instead of flops.
What are brand extensions?
A brand extension, or brand stretching, is when a known brand uses its name to transfer its products to a new industry or transform a product in a unique way. This strategy is high risk, high reward, though a strong enough brand image can keep the risk in check.
In order to get a good feel for this concept, let’s look at some examples.
Creative examples of brand extension success
The following examples are interesting ways that brands have attempted to stretch their brand further. Take note of what worked and why.
1. Arnold Schwarzenegger Supplements
Arnold Schwarzenegger, the famous bodybuilder and actor, took his talents, his name and his muscles to the sports supplement industry with a line of signature products that everyone could use, giving them a chance to take the same muscle-exploding nutrition as him.
Why it worked: This brand extension had a leg up on other extensions, because it not only played on Arnold’s celebrity status, but it also made use of his expertise. Being a champion bodybuilder, it was easy for Arnold to extend to the supplement industry, creating a product that people could identify by his name and image.
2. Harley Davidson T-Shirts
The Harley Davidson brand is known for having the market of luxury motorcycles cornered, since they’re the only ones who can make the bigger models function and sell. Putting their logo onto other merchandise seemed like a no-brainer brand extension.
Why it worked: The thing about Harley Davidson is it’s a cult brand, with many followers willing to buy exclusively Harley for the rest of their riding lives. This loyalty made an extension completely natural, and it worked on t-shirts because now the brand’s riders and fanatics could show their Harley support while riding their bikes.
3. Snickers Ice Cream Bars
Snickers candy bars have essentially stayed the same throughout the years, both in the recipe and their size and shape. Sure, there are slight variations (fun-size for Halloween), but for the most part, it is a stable, unchanging product. That is, until they attempted an extension to ice cream bars.
Why it worked: Snickers was able to move into the freezer section with a similar but different product, while its classic candy bar remained a hit at the cash register. People who wanted the same great flavors they were used to an ice cream bar form surely enjoyed this extension.
4. Pokemon Toys
Pokemon was an extremely popular kids television program, an animated show featuring creatures each with their own special unique powers. Like many popular kids shows, it seemed only natural to offer toys that the fans could buy and collect.
Why it worked: The Pokemon TV show is about collecting many different characters, so it would make sense that the toys would be so sought after for fan collections. The action figures were nearly endless thanks to the show’s many different characters available. There was almost no limit to the amount of merchandise in toys the Pokemon brand could come up with.
5. Tide Stain Remover Pen
The Tide Stain Remover Pen was a brand extension that took the main benefit of Tide products and put their efficacy to use in a new item, giving people an on-the-go way to clean their clothes without having to do laundry.
Why it worked: When a brand has cemented itself as something, it becomes easier for brand extensions to be effective. In this case, Tide had become very well-known as an effective laundry detergent, qualifying them to re-project their authority in this area to a different item, the pen.
6. George Foreman Grill
The George Foreman Grill is one of the better selling products in the realm of ‘as seen on TV’ items, since it’s so convenient, has a celebrity brand attached to it and is effective as a grill. It touched on the idea of convenience before it had become a consumer hit.
Why it worked: Similar to the Arnold Schwarzenegger supplement line, the George Foreman grill relies on celebrity status to extend a brand. However, unlike in the case of the Arnold muscle-building products, George Foreman isn’t showcasing his proficiency. Instead, he’s showcasing his name and popularity. People recognize the George Foreman brand thanks to his celebrity status as a boxer, and this helped up the perceived quality of the grill.
7. Reese’s Puffs Cereal
Similar to the Snickers Ice Cream Bar, the Reese’s Puffs cereal essentially modified the physical being of a product. It banked on the fact that it could take an extreme idea and modify it to a reasonable medium.
Why it worked: The marketing campaigns Reese’s ran almost wrote themselves, with commercials that showed shocked consumers seeing this brand extension. The reason this extension worked is it managed to bring a candy product to life in a cereal without overwhelming the consumer with the sweetness expected.
Now that we’ve seen some extensions that worked, let’s take a look at some that didn’t.
Flops and failures
The following brand extensions ended up flopping. Use these as a cautionary tale to avoid mistakes.
Heinz Purple Ketchup and Pepsi Crystal
These two are basically the same brand extensions from different brands, so I grouped them together. Pepsi is a brown color, Heinz Ketchup is red. Those are facts of life like the color of the sky, at least in terms of the customer’s mind. However, one day both these brands changed the texture of their product, creating a purple ketchup (Heinz) and a clear soda (Pepsi).
What went wrong: Customers are often able to enjoy a brand extension because it serves a purpose other than novelty. There is no purpose to either of these extensions other than flash and noise, and as such, they failed.
LifeSavers Soda
What went wrong: This one seems puzzling on the surface, especially when we consider that Reese’s Puffs cereal is a similar brand extension that was successful. However, there are some minor differences we must take into consideration. First, in the case of Reese’s to breakfast cereal, chocolate breakfast cereals weren’t unheard of at this time (Cocoa Puffs, etc.) making the jump much more stable. Soda on the other hand isn’t meant to taste all that sweet, at least not to the point where you’re drinking candy.
When it came to Lifesavers soda, it might have done okay if customers got to try before they buy, but as it was, they just couldn’t stomach the idea of drinking what they perceived to be an overly-sweet soda.
Final thoughts
As you can tell from the examples above, brand extensions are like an elaborate maze with tons of traps and dead ends.
On one hand, brand extensions are risky. On the other, there are plenty of brands that are able to make them work. If you’re willing to put in the right effort and plan ahead, you might be able to pull it off. Good luck!

December 17, 2020|
“Your personal brand is what people say about you when you are not in the room – remember that. And more importantly, let’s discover why!” – Chris Ducker
Wouldn’t it be nice if you could receive a notification every time a customer had a positive or negative thought about your brand? It would surely help you understand how to adjust to their preferences.
For now, this technology doesn’t exist, but you can still get the next best thing by measuring brand favorability in other ways.
This article will walk you through the ways to measure and then improve your overall brand favorability.
What is brand favorability?
Brand favorability is an in-depth measurement of how a brand is performing, particularly in terms of how well audiences perceive it in different areas. This is often measured by things like emotional closeness, positive or negative changes to the brand and customer relationship and the extent of their brand awareness.
Simple, effective ways to measure brand favorability
The most important part of measuring your brand favorability is to use the right metrics. I’ve come up with the following ways to evaluate favorability optimally.
Remember that none of these measurements will be truly beneficial without first promoting strong brand awareness, which ensures your brand is visible initially.
Evaluate your marketing campaigns
“Start by knowing what you want and who you are, build credibility around it and deliver it online in a compelling way.” – Krista Neher
There are a few things that need to happen in order for you to thoroughly and effectively judge whether or not your marketing campaigns are helping or hurting your brand favorability. First, you need to make sure that audiences are responding favorably to your advertisements. This not only includes liking the content, but also how well they are able to link the ad to your specific brand. The best way to do this is to run tests and take surveys.
As you might have guessed, the next part of evaluating your marketing campaigns is finding out how effective the advertisement was for your brand. Are audiences spreading the message and story of your brand? Are they also now more likely to purchase your products or services?
There are even some tools that offer up-to-date measurements of ongoing marketing campaigns, if you need further assistance in managing this category. For example, some social media sites offer analysis of campaigns directly on their platforms. Facebook’s list tests are one such tool.
Enhance the effort and outreach surrounding your surveys
It’s likely that most brands have some sort of survey system in place to help them determine their brand favorability. However, it’s just as likely that they’re not maximizing the potential of these surveys.
There are different types of surveys, all of which have their own unique benefits. Consider adding some of these to your repertoire if you’re not using them already.
The first approach is to narrow your focus, which creates results that are less likely to extend to unqualified users. The trade-off is naturally a smaller sample size.
The next thing you can do to improve your surveys is extend the outreach of your participants. There are systems in place which make this easier to manage, such as Qualtrics, to guide this step.
Lastly, consider adjusting the different types of questions in the survey, and create a more diverse and comprehensive collection methodology to retrieve more information about your favorability from participants.
Supplement your efforts with brand measurement software tools
Brand measurement systems are designed to give brands a chance to get a more data-driven look at their favorability. It’s ideal for those who need a more in-depth analysis to base their decisions on. It’s also an important tool for anyone who needs to measure brand favorability but is limited in time and resources. Keep in mind your budget when adding these systems so that you maximize the return they have the potential to bring.
It’s also important to find a brand measurement tool that tracks other factors that can feed into brand favorability directly, such as brand awareness and brand image. You’ll most likely want to find a system that is customizable and has the ability to gather a large number of customer responses.
Now that you have some effective ways to measure your brand favorability, let’s look at some methods to help you boost it.
Unique ways to improve brand favorability
The following tips, if followed alongside your data and analysis, will give your brand the best chance to increase its favorability dramatically.
Refer to your metrics regularly
The measurement methodologies I put forth above are meaningless if you don’t use them as a way to increase your brand favorability. In its simplest, the idea is to see where your favorability is lagging behind and try to improve in those areas.
You’ll need to step back and examine all the information and feedback you collected, take a step towards fixing any problems and then once again examine the results. This is definitely not a one-time process, so be prepared to stick with it for the long haul. On top of trying to improve favorability using your measurements, make sure to schedule a re-evaluation of your metrics as well. Without these efforts, you’ll never know if your improvements are working – or what you need to improve next.
Consider your content
Brands often think they have content ‘covered,’ but so many are guilty of missing massive opportunities to improve their brand favorability. There are a few different things you can do to make sure this isn’t a problem for your brand.
First, consider your content outreach. How many different users have legitimate access to your brand’s content? Taking it one step further, how many of these users are the right match for the content you’ve created? In order for your content to be fully absorbed, it has to be read by people who are likely to enjoy it.
Next, think about the type of content you create and determine if it’s as effective as it could be. The most important aspect is your story. Of course, brand story won’t be in every piece of content, but it should be a guiding factor in many pieces that are created.
Revisit your target market research
This is one of the most underutilized strategies in boosting brand favorability. Many brands locate their target market, make a few evaluations and consider the matter settled. This restricts the possibility of improving favorability because it fails to implement new ideas that might be rewarding for audiences.
One way to use your target market research to your advantage is to discover new trends and ideas that might please customers. For example, let’s say that you find out that the majority of your customers would prefer a certain type of product material or service functionality. They might want your brand to move toward a more conscientious direction concerning production of a product. Uncovering this type of information has huge potential for boosting brand favorability.
Find your own unique path to brand favorability
Brands are rightfully concerned with maintaining relationships with customers. Yet, they regularly forget to actively foster their brand favorability.
There’s no reason to disregard such a potentially strong concept, especially with how competitive the world of brands has become. Make sure you have a comprehensive strategy in place.

72,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-identity/,"5 tips to give your brand identity some real pop
September 12, 2020|
Consider this: millions and millions of companies try to stand out among their competitors – very few of them actually succeed.
With all the failed brands fallen by the wayside, you might second guess your own efforts. I’m going to tell you right now – don’t!
In fact, I’d be willing to bet that a few simple changes to your brand identity could help accomplish your goals.
What is brand identity?
A brand identity is your company’s personality according to how customers experience it. It is a combination of your brand values, messaging and public representation. Brand identity incorporates things such as logos, color schemes and fonts in attempts to positively define itself for customers.
Being unique is better than being perfect.
There’s a reason this quote is so prevalent – because it’s true. This idea has stood the test of time, making unique brands succeed where others fail. These successful brands win, not by having the best product or service, but by creating a brand identity that truly stands out.
Successful brands are unique brands. This is the most important thing to remember – the one pattern that stands out above all else.
Successful brands create exciting personas that are impossible for customers to ignore.
In this article, I’ll give you the secrets successful companies use to create their brand identity.
Creating a captivating brand identity that truly stands out
The following tips will change the way you think about brand identity.
1. Express who you are, always and absolutely
“No other version, no matter how perfect it is, would ever feel better than being your true self.” – Edmond Mbiaka
What if your favorite brand, who in the past had always spoken to you in a corporate tone, sent you a lighthearted newsletter full of funny GIFs? This would throw you off, and not in a good way.
To avoid this confusion, be true to your company values and ideals, as well as the brand persona you’ve created.
That’s not to say that you should never try something new. However, there’s a difference between taking a new angle and confusing your customers.
Part of building our identity is consistency. In order to show our target audience that we are the personality we’ve built, there needs to be general brand consistency from campaign to campaign.
So, what kind of ways can we go about doing this? For starters, there needs to be a conscious effort with each email, newsletter, campaign and project to write and talk in a consistent tone.
Over the years your company has created a specific persona – live up to it in every communication and advertisement, otherwise you’ll let audiences down.
Ultimately, be true to your company’s ideals in order to express the right message and fulfill customer perceptions of your brand.
Now that you’re on the right path to displaying brand solidarity, let’s dive into some key examples that show successful businesses in action.
2. The most successful companies can’t hide their brand identity. Learn from them!
“Experience is a master teacher, even when it’s not our own.” – Gina Greenlee
When you see a golden ‘M’ on a sign, chances are you think of french fries, hamburgers or a face-painted, red-haired clown. Furthermore, you might think of things like smells, ‘I’m lovin it’ slogans and food-box toys. Why is this important?
This shows that McDonalds is much more than a simple logo on a sign. They’ve built a company that gives customers a reason to believe in them.
The customers know that when they visit a restaurant with the golden arch logo, they’re getting everything the company represents and nothing less. Mcdonald’s essentially turned their logo design into something more than just a logo.
When it comes to popular brands, the most important thing to remember is that all of their successful campaigns are available for everyone to see. They can’t hide their methods of branding from the public.
Really let that sink in for a minute: the absolute best brand identities are on display at all times.
So, what can we do with this information? It’s not as if we can just copy these successful examples. But we can learn what works and why. Even the most basic research can put us on the right path.
Think about the following questions concerning effective brands: how, what and when. These are the big three you need to ask to extract all the information you can from successful campaigns. Here’s a brief rundown of each to get you started in your research:
How
Ask yourself, how did this company influence brand perception? Also consider how they connected things such as their logo to these positive perceptions.
What
Determine what kind of things this company’s logos and color schemes elicit. How do they make you feel when you see them?
When
Figure out why a company releases a certain slogan, layout or color scheme at a certain time. What types of events in the world would influence this decision?
Once you’ve researched a brand with these particular ideas in mind, it’s possible to come up with some key conclusions.
On a very basic level, this outlines how successful companies built their brand identity. More importantly, it allows us to begin structuring our own identity process to emulate their strategies.
With your creative processes in place, and a key message for your target audience, it’s time for the next step: preventing brand decay.
3. Will your brand identity stagnate? Not if you follow these tips
“The less you move on the ground the more the world moves around.” – Ana Claudia Antunes
If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. When it comes to brand identity, if we’ve cultivated it successfully, it will be tempting to abide by this saying.
However, our brand might never really ‘break’. Instead, it will diminish and stagnate.
Now, does this mean we need to change our logo every year? Of course not (though a logo change or re-work is acceptable).
Instead, our efforts should be aimed toward finding new ways to intrigue customers. We should also add to our brand identity without changing brand identifiers.
We see it all the time with new company campaigns – a fresh slogan, revamped logo, commercial theme or new jingle. These are attempts, not to fix a brand identity, but rather to keep it from stagnating.
For example, look at the Pepsi logo from their inception to now. It’s easy to speculate as to why they made the changes they made. Every change was minor, meaning they simply prevented a brand stand-still rather than overhaul their identity.
As you can see, it began as a red, cursive logo that reads ‘Pepsi-Cola’. Eventually, around the 1950s, they put the text onto a picture of a bottle cap.
They also changed it from red to red white and blue. The new color scheme could have been part of their ‘When’ process (as we discussed earlier, the ‘How’, ‘What’ and ‘When’).
Maybe this move came as a way to appeal to US consumers (Pepsi is an American company). The bottle cap addition also makes sense, considering the drink came bottled.
In the 1960s, the ‘Pepsi-Cola’ text switched to simply ‘Pepsi’, and the font was no longer in cursive. Two things could potentially have happened here.
First, Pepsi might have been separating itself from their main competitor, Coca-Cola. By calling it ‘Pepsi’ without the cola, they attempted to differentiate.
Switching from cursive could be for a lot of reasons. One possible factor was the prevalence of typewriters, which may have resulted in less cursive throughout society.
The next few decades brought about only minor changes. Most importantly, the brand can now paste their logo, the red white and blue circle, on a soda can and almost everyone will understand that it’s Pepsi.
These small transformations kept Pepsi in the game without requiring drastic changes. Looking at their logo now, it’s clear they made wise choices, especially when you consider American schools mostly don’t teach cursive anymore.
Consider changes that will similarly keep your company in the game.
Now that you’re equipped to prevent brand stagnation, let’s dive into the visual details that make up a strong brand identity.
4. Build a company logo, color scheme or layout that represents so much more
Imagine you see a trailer for a new hit movie, but the lead actress is wearing a mask in every shot. The preview ends with the title, never revealing who the actress is.
Even if she is the most popular movie star in the world, it doesn’t matter. The trailer failed to show her face to the audience, indicating she’s in the movie.
If the trailer displayed her face, the movie company would have benefited from the perceptions audiences have of her.
These perceptions probably include traits like, ‘amazing actress’, ‘dramatic’, ‘powerful’ and ‘versatile’.
The idea here is that by correctly identifying the actress, the trailer gains so much more credit from the audience.
The same can be said of a company’s color schemes and logos. These visual indicators require brand recognition, not just so customers understand that a product or ad is from your specific business, but because it promotes the positive aspects of a company.
The logo is usually on all things related to a company, making it extremely important. Customers see a specific logo and feel certain emotions, positive or negative. These lead them to make decisions whether to continue with a company or go elsewhere.
Don’t miss the opportunity to capture audiences with the layouts and logos they’ve come to know.
Remember that you’re doing so much more than identifying a product – you’re identifying your company’s values and ideals.
5. Finding your target audience is like discovering treasure – treat the process as such
This step is usually handled incorrectly, which leads to unsatisfying results. Finding a target audience is not a chore and the research shouldn’t turn people into numbers.
In fact, when you discover the right group, it will have been through an understanding of key concepts, such as your company’s vision, values and unique traits.
Furthermore, understanding your audience allows you to create a brand persona which has flair, excitement and other positive attributes that will cater to your target market.
If you reduce the target market to statistics and data without deeper consideration, chances are you’ll miss out on connecting with customers who would truly love your brand.
Closing thoughts
Building a meaningful brand is not just about creating a pretty logo. It’s about unearthing passionate audiences, creating dynamic personas and bringing deeper meaning to customers.
That’s why brand identity is so crucial – no one is going to have powerful thoughts or feelings about a logo in and of itself, no matter how beautifully it’s designed.

73,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-image/,"The true power of influence: Crafting your impactful brand image
September 7, 2020|
Do your favorite brands understand your needs? Do they have a personality that connects with you?
Your feelings about them are their brand image. The most successful brands do extensive customer research to craft their methods of branding.
In this article, I’ll give you the tools needed to influence audiences so they feel positive about your brand.
What is brand image?
Brand image is the overall feeling or perception a customer has toward a brand. It is how each person feels about the values, persona, purpose and identity of brands. Brand image is ultimately influenced by each customer’s interactions, both positive and negative.
Think of brand image like the consumer’s perspective of a brand’s values and identity. No matter what a company does, they can’t directly change their image.
Keep in mind that not everyone shares the same ideas about your brand. As a result, there are a lot of nuanced tasks that go into these branding strategies.
However, it’s possible to position your brand in ways that positively influence your brand image, which boosts success.
Let’s start off with some key benefits to help you out.
Unique benefits that prove the value of brand image
Here are some of the more important, lesser-known reasons that brand image is useful.
Break into new markets with ease
Gatorade was founded in 1965, and it was quite the hit. In fact, it popularized the concept of a sports drink.
Powerade wasn’t founded until 1988. Clearly, entering into the sports drink market would be difficult, considering the grasp Gatorade currently had on it.
However, Powerade came from a company with a strong brand image, Coca-Cola. By having an established brand, they were able to create new products and succeed in a different market. Powerade is still around and thriving, for what it’s worth.
The better the brand image, the faster the brand spreads
“If people believe they share values with a company, they will stay loyal to the brand.” – Howard Schultz
It’s easy to forget, at a time when we have access to so many different marketing and advertising channels, that a lot of new customers discover brands through word of mouth.
Of course, without a unique and powerful image to entice brand loyalty, it’s unlikely anyone will recommend your products and services to a friend or family member.
Everyone likes to give good advice, it’s a great feeling. If audiences see you as trustworthy, they’ll make recommendations, knowing they won’t lead their friends astray.
Increases in sales, revenue
A strong brand image plays a role in customer behavior. Just as we wouldn’t recommend an untrustworthy brand to a friend, we also wouldn’t buy their products or services.
Therefore, it’s clear that purchases are a direct result of a positive image. Build yours up to further increase revenue.
Don’t confuse image with identity, but recognize similarities
“A brand is no longer what we tell the consumer it is—it is what consumers tell each other it is.” – Scott Cook
Consider the following example:
Sid is a 55-year-old man who wants to reconnect with his younger years. He decides to shave his hair into a spiky mohawk. He then dyes this mohawk green.
Next, he puts on some leather pants and a jean jacket stitched with logos of his favorite punk rock bands.
He heads to the grocery store and notices people staring at him. He thinks, “Wow, I am so punk rock. I look like I am 21 again.”
This is brand identity in a nutshell. It’s how the brand presents itself and sees itself to be.
In this same example, the grocery store gawkers seeing Sid think, “Wow, that guy looks too old to be dressing like that!”
This is brand image exemplified. It’s how the audience (the grocery store go-ers) sees your brand (Sid, the 55-year-old with a green mohawk).
Brand identity is similar to brand image and influences it greatly. However, it’s clear that they’re different.
If we study our brand image and get negative feedback, we may adjust our brand identity as a result.
Keep this relationship in mind while thinking about the many phases and issues related to branding.
3 examples of successful brand images
Let’s take a look at some companies who developed effective brand image:
1. Lamborghini
Lamborghini is an interesting brand, having created an image that represents a higher level of quality. People view Lamborghini like a club that they would like to someday get into.
Their models go beyond luxury, representing performance and sport. This separates them from competitors like Rolls-Royce, a comfort-luxury ride.
On the Lamborghini website are detailed model specifications and images. There are no prices next to the cars. In contrast, visit Chevrolet’s website and the price of each model is listed right next to it.
These nuances build a level of brand differentiation, which is intriguing. In fact, exclusivity often draws people in even further.
2. Cabela’s
Cabela’s is an outdoor clothing and equipment brand that cultivated an image of sturdy, self-sufficient gear.
Cabela’s understood something about their target market that others didn’t – that outdoor gear is about memories and nostalgia. Instead of focusing on the material of winter gloves, they explain the ways their gloves will keep you warm in the ice house with your family on vacation.
Their advertising campaigns create this unique image as well, with outdoorsy colors, videos of kids having fun on a fishing trip and families camping outside.
3. Zappos
Zappos, an online shoe and clothing store, managed to create an image that is widely recognized as one of the most trustworthy, caring and thoughtful brands around.
They’ve always been known to provide an amazing customer experience and offer overwhelmingly superior customer service.
Most recently, they’ve been in the spotlight for offering support to anyone who needs it during the current pandemic and subsequent lockdown. Without requiring any purchase, people were able to call Zappos reps and chat about whatever they’d like.
It’s exciting to see brands create such positive images for themselves. So how can we do the same? Let’s start by looking at some unique strategies.
Strategies to revolutionize your process
It’s not enough to research how to improve our image – we need to think meaningfully about it. How are we going to make this happen? What ways will a method or tactic work? These types of deeper questions should be a large part of the consideration stage.
To give you a strong base, here are some powerful strategies.
1. Don’t just vary your content – transform it!
Content is a way to develop strong bonds with customers. It informs them of new decisions while establishing company values and building voice.
By now, most brands attempt to diversify their content in order to reach as many different markets as possible. This results in different mediums as well, such as newsletters, articles and white papers.
However, this is only half the battle. Building brand image is all about learning how customers view you. Since no one is perfect, no content is either. In fact, a lot of content fails to connect with target audiences.
Instead of diversifying content and extending its outreach to new markets, try re-creating different pieces and taking new approaches. Chances are, if you take an in-depth look at your content, there will be things to change.
2. However much you know about your audience, it isn’t enough. Keep digging.
Our efforts aren’t valuable if they don’t meet the needs and expectations of our audience. Knowing this, it’s important to put in the extra effort to evaluate the market and re-test our methods.
We might have a good idea of who our audience is and what they’re all about, but that’s not enough. People move, they age, they change and their needs evolve. If we lock them into a category, we’re bound to fail.
As a general rule, it’s important to gather information such as age, location and interests. Of course, you’ll want different customer data than other brands, so personalize your research.
If you want to discover new information about a specific market, there are tools that give detailed insight. SparkToro, for example, informs you of significant choices your target audience makes.
SparkToro removes the need for extensive surveys and exhaustive research. Instead, it delivers information about your target market, such as what types of articles they read, videos they watch and profiles they follow.
Our team recently used SparkToro and found it was very useful, saving time we otherwise would have spent researching on our own.
3. Pinpoint optimal brand visuals and don’t stray too far
“Design is the silent ambassador of your brand.” – Paul Rand
Using an example that we mentioned earlier, Cabela’s uses color schemes that represent the outdoors. Their logos and other brand elements blend into nature.
Similarly, we want to thrive for visuals that represent our brand image.
Similarly, we want to thrive for visuals that represent our image. If a customer feels a certain way about us, try to match and uphold that feeling with our logos and other brand elements.
Once we’ve locked in a distinct group of visuals that work well, minimize any changes surrounding it.
While it’s fine to make changes to your visuals from time-to-time, they should be within reason and not destroy someone’s image of your brand.
4. Marketing tactics: The right message in the wrong place is the wrong message
It’s impossible to boost brand success without an effective marketing plan. Once you’ve narrowed your target market, it’s time to reach them through carefully-constructed content and campaigns.
However, the right message is only as good as the medium it’s on. If you’re targeting SUV drivers on Instagram, but research has shown almost no SUV owners use Instagram, it won’t matter how creative the campaign.
Once you’re on the right medium and targeting the correct audience, feel free to get creative. As we see time and time again, brands willing to distance themselves from the norm break out with successful campaigns.
5. Ask yourself if your current brand persona is working
Brand persona is the personification of a brand through specific values and character. It is the human face of a brand.
Oftentimes we build a brand persona that matches our image, but doesn’t connect with audiences. Even though it’s not logical, we have to respect the results and adjust.
Our brand persona may have grown outdated, or it’s possible that our audience has changed. Whatever the case, this type of re-evaluation and adjustment is essential for brand growth.
Tying everything together
We can greatly influence our brand image. However, we can’t, no matter how hard we try, have ultimate control over it. Accepting this reality is key to a better image.
Be willing to try new things, get creative and take extra research time to truly understand how to push for a more impactful brand.

Our retail customers know this better than anyone. With a recent wave that has lead to the demise of formerly well-loved retailers like Toys R Us and Sears, most retail brands today are scrambling to figure out what it takes to stay afloat.
The customer experience is everything
Getting it right once, twice, or ten times is not enough. Customers are being inundated with options every second of the day, and their expectations are changing faster than ever. The breakneck pace of retail in the digital age demands that retail teams continuously improve to deliver the best product, service, and experience, or risk being taken down by someone who is doing it better.
It takes less than 50 milliseconds for your digital marketing to make a first impression on a prospective customer. Your visual content is what powers that experience – and if your team, process, and technology are not in a place that allows you to iterate quickly and continuously so you can get to market fast, you’re probably already behind.
Becoming agile
The most innovative marketing teams in the world are increasingly making the shift to an Agile Marketing methodology, where large projects that would traditionally be scoped out for longer timelines are broken down into smaller chunks and worked on iteratively.
Because the process is designed to move so quickly, Agile marketing forces you to be absolutely clear and transparent about why you’re prioritizing something and what outcomes you’re looking for. Teams who implement an Agile approach are able to shift gears more quickly, which means greater speed to market in getting campaigns and marketing programs up and running, and faster response to market feedback.
Powering up your performance
Without the right technology in place to help dismantle roadblocks that might stall a project for hours, days, or weeks, even the most nimble project management approach won’t keep you ahead of the curve. Retailers who are running circles around the competition power their customer experience with compelling visual content, and are continuously delivering new content and iterating to improve the experience. Eliminating high-volume, time consuming lasts like image requests is crucial to keeping the team focused on achieving business objectives.
Enabling self-service across the creative organization can be a game changer for brands who manage hundreds of thousands of digital assets across cloud storage, hard drives, and email. Every day, we see retail marketing teams like Bumkins, Godiva Chocolatier and Taos Footwear move from being bottlenecks within the organization to spending more time supporting new visual content for campaigns with Canto.

Without requiring even a single purchase of their product, Ben & Jerry’s grew their brand loyalty, simply by getting creative and showing they care about their fellow humans.
This is just one of many examples that details some unique yet powerful ways for brands to grow. In this article, I’ll guide you through some key strategies to create brand loyalty – strategies that aren’t yet on everyone’s radar.
What is brand loyalty?
Brand loyalty is a customer’s inclination to habitually purchase a product or service from a brand, regardless of situational changes or competitor’s attempts to entice them. It often so happens that the loyal customer will become an active supporter of the brand, suggesting it to friends and family.
There is an underlying concept of brand loyalty that cannot be understated: the loyal customer sticks with their brand no matter the current price, accessibility or even satisfaction of the product or service.
They’ve stumbled upon what they like or want, and they’ve found a brand who they like and want to stick with. No amount of sales, specials and advertising campaigns is going to pull them away.
With a good understanding of the concept, it becomes clearer what kind of things need to be done in order to build brand loyalty. Before we dive into how to do that, let’s first consider the reasons why we should.
3 reasons to focus more on building brand loyalty
It could take quite a while to give every single advantage associated with brand loyalty. Instead, I’ll give you three that really stand out:
1. Brand loyalty breeds brand advocacy
We hear all the time that brand advocates are much more valuable to a brand than even the loyalest of customers. This is because advocates often lure other customers to a brand, as well as stay loyal to it themselves.
A brand advocate is someone who promotes a brand without being paid to do so. Their promotion is valuable because it’s free and effective. People are more likely to make a purchase based on a brand advocate over an advertisement.
It’s clear that creating brand advocates is crucial to success, which brings us back to brand loyalty. Since we know that brand loyalty can eventually generate advocacy, it shows us how important brand loyalty can be, especially long term.
2. Gives brands a leg up over direct competitors
“In the world of internet customer service, it’s important to remember your competitor is only one mouse click away.” – Doug Warner
Here’s the reality about our competition: They want all of our customers, and they’ll do everything in their power to get them. Every move we make, advertisement we put up or new product we create, they’ll try to outdo and undermine.
Now, imagine that all their efforts to steal our customers away were completely in vain. No matter how much better their product became or how much cheaper their prices, our customers wouldn’t dare budge.
This is brand loyalty’s greatest strength – acting like a coat of armor that shields us from all attacks from the competition.
3. Increases overall revenue
The above two benefits feed directly into this one, making it a bit more obvious. Obvious or not, it needs mentioning, because it’s the result brands strive for when building loyalty.
Nearly 70% of the average company’s business, in fact, is from repeat customers. When you factor in all the benefits of brand loyalty – promotes advocacy, helps brands outduel competitors, increases customer willingness to pay a higher price – it’s no wonder it boosts revenue.
Of course, each case will be different, but we can calculate a general evaluation based on some data. For example, roughly 40% purchase from a brand they like regardless of price. Similarly, small amounts of increased customer loyalty results in exponential increases in profits, usually 5-10x as much.
All these benefits add up, making loyalty an undeniably important factor. So, how do we work toward building brand loyalty?
The unique strategies needed to build brand loyalty
“I’ll take fifty percent efficiency to get one hundred percent loyalty.” – Samuel Goldwyn.
Some of the ideas I’m going to suggest here might surprise you, but that’s a positive. There are plenty of other brands out there fighting for the exact same thing as you. If you’re going to war using identical weapons, things will be fairly even.
That’s why it’s important to look for ways to be better – using methods your competitors aren’t using or even aware of.
I’ll begin with some fundamental strategies, then dive into some of the more uncommon yet effective approaches.
The fundamental strategies needed to succeed
As promised, these are the bare-minimum, essential strategies that will make building brand loyalty a reality. Follow each best you can at every turn.
Emphasize product focus and support
This is quite simple, yet it reigns supreme above all other tasks when it comes to building brand loyalty: the product or service you offer needs to remain the main target of your efforts.
Let’s face it, the reason customers stick with a brand is mostly (at least early on) the quality of the service or product provided, and the support it is given. No amounts of brand values or virtues will create loyalty if the product is lacking.
However, that’s not to say that your service has to beat the competition – it doesn’t. But it does have to be quality enough and meet customer needs adequately to build any type of loyalty.
It’s important to note that even though creating brand loyalty ensures a customer will continue to use your product over the competition, the fight to maintain them shouldn’t end there.
Get out in front of potential problems or stagnations with research and analysis and make adjustments before loyalty fades. It might even help to check in with customers for potentially valuable feedback.
No matter what, you’re not building brand loyalty without top-notch customer service
Approximately ¾ of customers admit that they wouldn’t mind spending a bit more on a product if the customer service was exceptional.
More importantly, at least for this topic, is the fact that nearly 90% of customers will continue to purchase from brands who provide top-notch customer service.
This goes beyond being friendly and helpful. Customer service that builds loyalty is more comprehensive.
As you strive for better customer service, keep up with your research to examine important trends. Just because customers might have expected a response to an email or message within four hours years ago, doesn’t mean that’s their expectation now.
Staying current on customer service trends will result in getting things right to meet essential needs and requirements.
Finally, pay attention to the different ways customers want to connect with your brand. This changes every so often. I’ll touch on this a bit more later.
Stay ahead of and adapt to consumer trends
As we noted with customer service, trends are pretty important to build brand loyalty. Consumer trends are especially essential, as they provide a blueprint to how a brand should change based on customer behavior.
It’s pretty rare for a trend to go unchanged for long periods of time. You’ll need to adapt quickly to stay relevant. One way to do this is through extensive research and data analysis. Future campaigns and changes should reflect your research.
Consider Netflix, for example. Their original model involved sending discs via mail to a house, then requiring customers return the discs in a provided envelope. Had they ignored the customer’s changing needs, they would have failed. However, they adapted, becoming a streaming service.
Now that you have a strong grasp of the basic tools required to boost brand loyalty, we’ll transition into some of the more unique ways to further your success.
Lesser-known brand loyalty-building strategies
Many brands fail to understand and attempt to follow the following strategies, which typically causes them to fail in general – especially regarding building brand loyalty.
Rewards and loyalty programs are dynamic – try to keep up
It makes sense that offering a loyalty program and other rewards would help create loyalty. However, just as we mentioned with consumer trends, your rewards and loyalty programs require a lot of attention to stay effective.
It’s one thing to offer some type of reward to customers to encourage purchases. That’s almost a given at this point, and doing so won’t give you an advantage over many competitors. However, Consider the opportunity you have to differentiate here.
Look at the ways that customers want rewards delivered or loyalty programs run. It seems like the more extensive and specific these services become, the more they create brand loyalty. Conversely, the more stale and stagnated they become, the less customers care about them.
Involvement and excitement are big proponents of a successful rewards program. Structure yours in a way that captures both these feelings while staying current with trends.
Lastly, the power of smartphones has allowed for more thoughtful rewards and loyalty programs that make customers feel like they’re working towards a goal each time they buy from a brand. Evaluate your rewards to see if they’re measuring up to these new and exciting programs.
Utilize the potential efficiency that digital connections offer
If a customer receives great customer service via email, in-person or over the phone, then gets poorer service from the same brand via social media, brand loyalty will be an impossibility. It’s vital, especially today, that your digital connection points don’t lag behind.
This applies to both the quality of the service as well as the other factors that customers expect, such as response times. If someone emails a company and receives a reply within 30 minutes, they will expect a similar response time when they connect on social media.
As social media continues to expand, this can become a bit more difficult. Fortunately, there are modern tools dedicated to help brands manage their overall social media experience. Buffer, for example, unifies all channels into one program, making it easy to quickly respond to questions from different sites.
Next, use the potential power of digital connections to build online groups that promote togetherness and other qualities. These will result in an increase in brand loyalty, as they usually entail deeper, more meaningful communication between customers and brands.
Remember that I’m not suggesting that your digital customer service should be focused on more. I’m simply pointing out that if there isn’t a seamless transition from one to the other, it will be harmful.
Focus on improving and maintaining brand experience
A meaningful brand experience helps customers see a brand in a different light. It often results in customers having positive feelings about a brand, which in turn creates loyalty.
So how does a positive brand experience boost brand loyalty? Consider the following example. In 2015, Microsoft promoted a new video game release for their Xbox system by having people compete against one another.
Their task was to be the last person standing among a group of eight who were in front of a promotional billboard in the freezing cold.
The event was streamed online, giving users an unforgettable experience that was sure to keep Xbox in the forefront of people’s minds and conversations for quite some time.
These types of moments let customers connect with a brand on an emotional level which, when partnered with a quality product, nurtures loyalty.
You’re now armed with some key tips to build brand loyalty, but there’s another concept to consider before we move onto some examples, and that’s whether you can lose brand loyalty or not.
Can you lose brand loyalty?
Brand loyalty can evaporate when consumer trends change, but the product doesn’t keep up with these changes.
If you’ve been selling a delicious chicken and red pepper sandwich for years, you’ll need to adapt if consumers turn against eating red peppers altogether. This is an obvious example, but it’s harder than it seems to change something that has worked for so long.
The good thing about brand loyalty is it’s hard to shake off in a brief few moments. Your customers will stick around even if you stagnate for a while. However, eventually they’ll want something more.
The best way to avoid losing it is to keep up with your crucial research of the markets and how customers are using products. If it helps, set some type of schedule to conduct analysis every so often.
Looking at successful brands often helps us move along the process. Therefore, we will examine some brands that did it right.
Some helpful examples of brand loyalty in action
The following three examples all demonstrate a completely different situation where a brand built loyalty. Use each to find your own path in the matter.
Coca-Cola
Coca-Cola is a helpful example brand to point to when it comes to loyalty because they have a direct competitor, Pepsi, which attempts to undermine Coke at every turn.
Despite these numerous attempts by Pepsi to lure away customers, Coke remains seemingly invincible and always comes away unscatched, thanks to their extensive loyalty.
In the ultimate case of ‘invincibility’, Coke decided to discontinue their long-running rewards program, which for whatever reason didn’t seem to deter their loyal customers from sticking around.
Apple
Apple doesn’t build brand loyalty through rewards programs. Instead, they stoke loyalty by incentivizing customers through products that build off one another.
For example, it only makes sense to pair your new iPhone with Airpods and an Apple Watch. Even if you initially don’t have the Apple brand in mind when considering earbuds and an electronic watch, you’ll likely land there because of how well they supplement your iPhone.
Essentially, Apple used creative marketing and product design to build brand loyalty.
Amazon
Amazon has cracked the code for brand loyalty, finding ways to give customers exactly what they want far better than anyone else can provide, all while keeping them coming back more and more often.
The biggest way Amazon tackled the brand loyalty concept was by offering the Amazon Prime service, which is a paid loyalty program that gives free shipping and streaming services to users.
Prime memberships act as a way to both retain customers and keep them happy, since it’s both a helpful service and a motivator to purchase only through Amazon (you’ve paid for Prime, why buy from anywhere else?).
Final thoughts
Building brand loyalty doesn’t have to be a complicated process.
But, it’s doubtful that you’ll keep customers from switching to the competition if you don’t have complexity in your strategies.
If your preparation, research and adherence to customers is on point, you’re sure to succeed.

April 20, 2022|
There’s an old adage among marketers that the average customer needs to have seven interactions with a company before making a purchase. These interactions can range from visiting the company’s website to simply hearing it mentioned in passing conversation. Each interaction builds familiarity and, ideally, trust so that when the customer is ready to make a purchase, they will already know what to expect from the company. This helps to explain why building a strong, consistent brand identity is so vital to an organization’s success. If people have positive associations with a brand, they’re more likely to turn to it when the time is right.
Why brand management is important
Brand management is the process of maintaining the integrity of your brand to raise awareness and trust with your customers. Over time, a successful brand management strategy not only raises the perceived value of your brand, but also improves customer retention and encourages people to become strident advocates for your products and services. But the benefits aren’t just confined to customer relationships. Organizations with a healthy brand identity have more engaged employees and have an easier time attracting talent and partners that are aligned with their mission and values.
When a brand is managed poorly, however, it becomes difficult for people to have faith in an organization or even take it seriously. Inconsistency is one of the fastest ways to undermine brand identity. Sharing the wrong images or graphics, using too many fonts, and featuring off-brand colors can leave your brand looking confused and unprofessional. One of the goals of brand messaging is to make people feel good about associating with your organization. That’s not going to happen if your branding efforts appear scattershot and lack clarity.
How to maintain brand consistency
Managing your brand effectively can be quite a challenge in an era with so many media channels available for reaching audiences. Not only are there more outlets to manage, but brand storytelling has also been democratized. While brand managers and marketing departments once monopolized control over how assets were shared, the growth of social media channels has effectively turned every person within an organization into a potential brand messenger. Making sure that all these people are on the same page and using the same assets is vital for ensuring brand consistency.
A good first step is to consolidate all brand assets into a single source of truth rather than storing them in multiple locations. When branded content is stored in various cloud platforms or scattered across individual computers, it’s almost impossible to maintain control over what is being shared and used to generate content. Consolidating assets in a centralized library provides greater visibility into how they’re being used and makes it easier to establish consistency.
Digital asset management (DAM) platforms are an ideal solution for streamlining and simplifying the storage, access, and sharing of brand assets. Once those resources have been consolidated into a single source of truth, there are a few additional steps that can help brand managers ensure they’re deploying brand assets more consistently.
Step 1: Create and share brand guidelines
Organizations frequently invest a lot of time and money into creating comprehensive brand guidelines that lay out very specific instructions for what images, fonts, colors, and tone of voice should be used when creating content or communicating with stakeholders. Unfortunately, these useful guidelines often end up languishing unseen in the depths of hard drives throughout the organization. Over time, small tweaks and changes to content can introduce a great deal of inconsistency into the brand.
By storing brand guidelines in the same location as other assets, it’s much easier to find and reference them when creating or sharing material. You can even create interactive guidelines that allow people to retrieve the colors, images, and fonts they need directly so they don’t have to track them down manually.
Step 2: Tag brand assets with metadata
Inconsistencies and mistakes are more likely to happen when people are in a hurry or frustrated by not being able to find what they need. The average marketing professional spends the equivalent of several weeks each year trying to track down specific assets for a project. This leads them to settle for “close enough,” which might mean using images that aren’t in the correct file format or resorting to a low-resolution copy taken from another source.
By consolidating brand assets within a DAM platform that provides a single source of truth for all content, you can use metadata, tags, and keywords to make it much easier to find things with a simple search. Rather than wasting time sifting through hundreds (or even thousands) of files to find the correct image in the correct format and resolution or trying to adapt another asset that may not be appropriate for use, people can quickly and easily locate exactly what they need to create or share content that’s consistent with your overall brand identity.
Step 3: Control access and usage rights
Just because brand assets are approved for usage and comply with your brand guidelines doesn’t mean that everybody should be able to use them whenever they want. Some of those assets may only be appropriate for specific content strategies, while others are intended exclusively for internal use rather than public-facing communications. Controlling who has access to which assets is an important step in maintaining brand consistency.
With a DAM platform, you can create dedicated libraries to share appropriate assets for different organizational uses. While your marketing team might have access to the entire collection of brand assets to generate content, you may set up a separate portal full of approved images, graphics, and videos that employees in other departments can use for presentations and social media. This allows you to maintain greater brand consistency while also making it easier for everyone within the organization to promote the brand itself.

March 9, 2022|
A strong, distinctive brand is essential for getting attention and building long-term relationships with customers in today’s competitive media environment. That’s why organizations dedicate so much time and money into building a brand identity that communicates their unique values and expertise. But cultivating a brand isn’t just a one-time investment that ends after you’ve designed your fancy logo and catchy mission statement. In order to communicate that identity and message effectively, you will need to implement a comprehensive brand management strategy.
What is brand management?
Brand management is the ongoing process of maintaining both the reputation and core essence of your brand in the public eye and among internal stakeholders. On a practical level, it consists of the day-to-day management of brand assets and standards, but it also involves efforts that strengthen people’s relationship with the brand. Well-executed brand management has the ability to raise the brand’s perceived value in the market, increase customer satisfaction, and encourage people to become outspoken advocates for your products and services.
Ideally, every interaction with your brand should reinforce the organization’s core identity and values. That means keeping to a consistent message, tone, and style that conforms to established branding guidelines. Using inappropriate, low quality, or outdated assets can quickly erode the overall integrity of the brand. Applying the wrong message over the wrong channel can also create confusion in the market. At best, customers might lose their sense of what the organization stands for. At worst, they could get the impression that it doesn’t actually live up to the values it professes to support.
Both situations will eventually undermine the integrity of the brand, which lowers its perceived value in the market and makes it difficult for both customers and employees to remain engaged. Given the tremendous resources organizations invest in developing their brand identity and the assets that support it, having a sound brand management strategy in place to protect and communicate it effectively is vital for success.
How to protect your brand integrity
Today’s organizations deploy brand assets across a variety of channels to help promote their story and generate greater awareness in the market. As the number of potential outlets for messaging continues to expand, more people are getting involved in that ongoing communication and messaging process. Without the proper tools that support effective brand management, it’s difficult to control which assets are being used and ensure that they meet established brand guidelines.
Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to strengthen your brand management and maintain the overall integrity of your brand.
1. Centralize brand assets
Organizations frequently leverage multiple storage platforms to enable hybrid teams and external collaborators to access content. These systems are rarely managed effectively, however, which forces people to waste time searching for the assets they need and makes it hard to know if they’re using content that’s aligned with existing brand standards. By consolidating approved assets in a centralized location, brand managers can create a single source of truth that eliminates confusion and streamlines collaboration. This is also the ideal place to store all brand guidelines, which provide clear documentation for the visual identity, voice, and style of all brand-related content. By keeping these guidelines in a public and easy-to-access location, it’s much easier to provide everyone in the organization (and external contributors) with clear instructions for creating and using brand assets, which protects the overall integrity of the brand. And since the brand guidelines are being stored right alongside those assets, there’s little opportunity for confusion or oversights. All things brand-related can be found in one place and all collaborators have access to them when they’re needed.
2. Create approval workflows
In order to create a single source of truth for brand assets, you need to have some form of approval process in place that tracks the status of content and ensures it is in accordance with your overall branding. Setting up an approval workflow that reviews how assets are being deployed can eliminate the sort of inconsistencies and inappropriate usage that can damage the brand’s integrity. If content doesn’t meet established guidelines or incorporates non-branded or even unlicensed material, it can be flagged for revision before it’s added to the library for general usage or shared over public channels.
3. Establish version control
The most successful brands evolve over time, whether they’re making sweeping changes or just undergoing a minor update to remain relevant in a competitive market. When it comes to digital assets, however, making changes can create confusion about which version is the most up-to-date. Without some form of version control in place, teams may inadvertently work from or share outdated versions. When customers see multiple iterations of branding all at once, they’re less likely to form strong, positive associations with the organization. Version control tools ensure that only the most recently updated versions of brand assets are available, which saves time, avoids redundancy, and strengthens brand integrity.
How a digital asset management platform improves brand management
A digital asset management platform (DAM) is an essential component of any successful brand management strategy. Designed specifically to help organizations organize, manage, and share assets like photos, graphics, video, and fonts among collaborative teams, DAM software provides a single source of truth that makes it easy to develop and distribute brand content. Customizable workflows can be set up to manage how assets are used and reviewed while version control tools ensure that everyone is always working from the most up-to-date copy of assets.
Canto provides all the DAM features your organization needs to ensure that all of your content is always on hand and on brand.

In 2010, Old Spice rebranded, giving their 75-year-old brand a light, quirky and funny new personality.
This helped Old Spice become more than just a deodorant company, all without changing their product.
They had an ‘aha’ moment, evolving by adapting to the changing market and audience. They did all this despite already having a successful brand.
When it comes to our own brand, seeing the light isn’t always so obvious. As a result, we sometimes stick (no pun intended) to what works until it doesn’t.
If you’ve built a successful brand, that’s great! But now comes another important part of the process – brand management.
Are you prepared to make necessary brand adjustments when the time comes?
In this article, I’ll go over the essential brand management components everyone needs to know in 2022.
Don’t be left with a formerly successful brand, while other revamped brands are connecting to your target audience.
What is brand management?
Brand management is a branding component that involves maintaining and bettering products, services and brand perception. Brand management, when practiced correctly, gives cost leverage, increases customer loyalty and establishes meaningful brand awareness. It also embodies the customer purchasing process relationship.
“Branding demands commitment; commitment to continual reinvention” – Richard Branson
It goes without saying that creating a brand is just the beginning of a longer process. Brand management is this longer process.
In order to have continued success, there needs to be a concerted effort to deliver dynamic branding.
Think of your business like a tree seed you’ve planted in the ground. Your brand is the leaves and branches that bloom as the business grows.
As the tree (business) grows (scales), the leaves/branches (brand) need to be trimmed and cut to adapt to this growth. This is why it’s so important to understand the basic principles of brand management.
Let’s begin with an overview of the basic benefits that come along with effective brand management.
Main brand management benefits
- Grows sales through increased customer advocacy
- Powers overall brand awareness
- Enhances pricing leverages
- Produces lifelong customer loyalty
- Helps brands scale
When looking at these benefits, remember that they’re only a reality for businesses that practice effective brand management. There are right and wrong ways to handle and maintain a brand.
In order to make sure you handle yours correctly, I’ll break down a few important principles.
Basic brand management principles you absolutely need to know
The necessary elements that make up these principles are straightforward. You need to involve these different elements to evaluate your branding endeavors and ultimately succeed.
When it comes to specific strategies, it’s possible to break free from the norm and manage your brand in a unique way. I’ll go over some of these unique strategies in the next section.
The following elements require constant assessment – the key to overall successful brand management. Here are the most relevant principles, as well as a breakdown of why each is important.
Brand equity
Brand equity creates value through reputation, impression and perception. It’s important because it changes the dynamic of a product or service that companies offer, since customers trust the brand over their perception of the product or service.
This in turn gives businesses the opportunity to increase their prices.
Here’s an example to help you remember brand equity. Imagine you’re going for a jog in the park and you come across two concession stands.
One is nameless, the other is “Gatorade.” The nameless stand is selling sports drinks for half the price of the Gatorade stand. It stands to reason that most people will still select the Gatorade stand based on the brand equity it holds.
Brand recognition
“Recognition is not a scarce resource. You can’t use it up or run out of it.” – Susan M. Heathfield
Brand recognition indicates how easy it is for audiences to identify your brand without hearing or seeing the brand name.
This is typically a visual element, as usually things like a slogan, color scheme, logo or packaging lead customers to recognize the brand. However, it does extend to things like audio, with brand advertisement jingles.
Brand recognition is crucial because it signals to customers whenever they see one of your products. This results in a higher chance for them to make a purchase.
If you’ve ever seen the start of an advertisement and knew exactly which brand was behind it without seeing their name, that was brand recognition in action.
We don’t often think about it, but it’s a powerful thing for a brand to be able to create that connection with customers.
Brand loyalty
Brand loyalty is when a customer is devoted to a particular brand over their competitors. Note that brand loyalty isn’t customer loyalty, which involves customer’s buying a product or service because of its specific quality.
Brand loyalty involves a customer buying a product or service based solely on their loyalty to the brand.
It is important because it leads to other benefits, such as word-of-mouth advertising.
Here’s an example demonstrating brand loyalty in action. Someone needs to buy four new tires for their car and chooses Goodyear because of their dedication to customers over the years.
Note that their decision to purchase had nothing to do with the product quality. This is how powerful brand loyalty can be, and why it must be evaluated constantly.
Knowing which principles to consider is only half the battle. Now it’s time to implement some unique brand management strategies that will help you succeed in 2022.
Brand management strategies you can’t ignore in 2022
It’s not enough to implement a basic brand management strategy. You need groundbreaking ideas that constantly challenge and revamp your ideas.
The following strategies were crafted with the concept in mind that a brand cannot possibly succeed without dynamic, unique ideas.
1. Do more than simply create a unique selling proposition – use it to your advantage
Your unique selling proposition (USP) sets you apart from competitors. A timeless example is M&M’s “melts in your mouth, not in your hand”. This USP-turned slogan distinguishes M&M’s from other candies. Furthermore, this brand contrast has been key to the success of M&M’s.
To create a unique selling proposition, understand where your product fits into the market. What makes it different from its competition? Is it more durable or cost-effective? How is your company different? Is it more innovative or stable?
Whatever it is, define it and write it down. For example: “Our company is the most creative and the product is the most stylish”.
Once you’ve defined your USP, use it to your advantage by turning it into a sexy key message. Use this as the backbone of your marketing activities – you’ll be surprised at how often it pops up.
2. Evaluation is an incomplete, inadequate piece of the puzzle. Follow this comprehensive model instead.
As I’ve pointed out in the principles section, evaluation of certain brand elements is essential. However, the mistake a lot of brands make is believing brand management is a process that begins and ends with evaluation. This just isn’t the case.
A better strategy to follow would entail a basic plan for evaluation, followed by a sustained plan for future re-evaluation. All of this would then be laid out in a detailed schedule, to ensure none of these measurements stagnate.
It’s best to follow a three-pronged process:
- Organize and list brand elements and assets: There are many different elements and assets you need to manage. Build a list to keep them organized. Also, keep in mind this will continually grow.
- Come up with a plan for all teams: Whatever type of plan you create, make sure it’s accessible to the necessary team members. This will help keep everything evaluated on time, which ensures goals are met.
- Re-evaluate the overall process: The key word here is re-evaluate. Make sure your processes get some extra attention, even after they’re created. Also, ensure this includes reviewing the manner in which it’s currently set up.
3. Brand assets require attention (and plenty of it!)
There are a lot of different assets that are a part of your specific brand. In order to truly create a successful brand management strategy, brand assets need some special attention.
In case you’re unsure what types of elements qualify as brand assets, I’ve created a list of a few of them.
Keep in mind that there are more brand assets, but these are the most important and/or the most overlooked.
Visual elements
“Good design…is intelligence made visible” – Zena O’Connor
Visual elements are the brand asset most people know best. There are quite a few things to consider when it comes to managing different visual elements.
First, it’s important to take note of the different visual elements you have control over. These are usually things such as logos, layouts and color schemes.
Sometimes a rebranding takes place and the visual elements get adjusted or changed, but this entails subtle changes that nudge visuals in a new direction. It’s important that whatever changes you make adhere to brand consistency.
Similarly, don’t think of your visual elements as tasks that require constant updates or changes. Instead, think of them as assets that need to be used correctly. This involves creating guidelines and rules that ensure they stay relevant across different mediums throughout new challenges.
Brand messaging
Brand messaging is a combination of your content language and the description of innovative features and services provided. It’s how a brand influences and inspires customers, giving them good reason to purchase a product or service.
Your brand messaging should be specific, expressing the brand’s ideals and values. There are a lot of different things that make brand messaging valuable.
It may tell a story of sorts, charging customer excitement and getting them on your side, as it were. Part of this task involves learning to understand your audience.
Once your messaging is established, continually evaluate new projects and campaigns to ensure the messaging is on-point. Check the overall tone and make sure it’s in-line with your brand.
Social media accounts
Some of your most important (and sometimes underestimated) brand assets are social media accounts. A common mistake companies make is creating an account that doesn’t fit with their brand. This happens more and more as brands expand their outreach to new platforms.
If, for example, they have a Twitter account where most of their tweets are friendly, funny and laidback, they cannot make a YouTube account and post serious, dramatic videos. Stay true to your brand throughout each social media account you make.
Keep in mind that each social media profile needs to have the same personality of your brand. They should behave in a manner that reflects brand ideals and values.
Website
“A website is a window through which your business says hello to the world.” – Amit Kalantri
Companies often ignore the potential power of their website or app. What they sometimes don’t realize is that it has the power to both entice a customer or turn them away.
Part of brand management includes caring for the well-being of a company website. This should consist of detailed analysis and continual evaluations, which will give further insight into how well the website adheres to the brand.
An easy example to get this point across is a website design agency’s homepage. No matter how good they might be in designing websites for their clients, if their own website fails to appear professional and modern tech-wise, no one will buy their services.
Some further options to give you the extra boost needed
With these strategies and principles in hand, you’ll be able to better navigate your brand. It’s important now to decide the direction you’d like to take your involvement in the brand management process.
This leaves us with a couple different choices: outsourcing some of our duties, or managing our brand internally with software systems.
Remember that there’s no right or wrong selection here. Some will prefer using a third-party, while others will like the features a software system gives them. Here’s a rundown of each option to help guide you to one or the other.
Outsourcing brand tasks to a brand management agency
Brand management can be overwhelming, especially as a company expands. Luckily, with these growing demands came a multitude of different options to help your situation. One such option is outsourcing your tasks to an agency that specializes in such procedures.
There are plenty of different agencies around the world willing to meet your needs and give you more time to handle other issues. Consider hiring a third party if branding has been a struggle for your teams.
Enhancing brand management internally with a software system
If outsourcing your tasks to a third party doesn’t fit your needs, consider a brand management software system. These powerful tools give extra help organizing and maintaining different brand assets.
Some of these software tools, such as digital asset management (DAM), help teams better manage their brand assets, such as logos, by providing a central repository.
One of the more powerful features of DAM is the accessible style guide, which gives an overview of brand assets to use. This includes the ability to see which font, logo and pictures to use.
DAM is also great at handling different copyright and security tasks, a must for companies in need of brand management. If you want to supplement your current process, a tool such as DAM is a perfect fit.
Implement these ideas to see how far a better brand can take you
The better you manage your brand, the better it will become. The more you review and analyze it, the higher its future efficacy will be.

November 11, 2020|
In some contexts, the need for some type of leader is obvious. Ships, countries and expeditions all need someone to guide things and provide order.
However, when it comes to brands, the waters get a little murkier, and understanding why a leader of some sort is necessary is a bit more abstract.
A brand manager can help you thrive in ways thought not possible previously. They are, after all, gatekeepers for things like products and services. Their efforts have ranging impacts from internal and external communications that influence brand image.
The following is a detailed explanation of what a brand manager does, why they’re important and what types of skills they need to have.
What is a brand manager?
A brand manager is responsible for implementing and maintaining brand strategies. They work extensively with colleagues across departments to ensure the brand is upheld and improved upon in all external marketing and communications. Their relationships with colleagues are key to their success.
It’s important that you’re aware of what a brand manager does exactly. They are fully responsible for coming up with unique strategies that help target and influence a brand’s intended audience. One of their most common tasks is maintaining brand integrity throughout different areas.
A brand manager is typically tasked with handling the following:
- Budgeting different branding projects
- Reviewing customer data
- Implementing branding strategies
- Scheduling media communications
- Managing product launches
Now that you have a base understanding of what a brand manager does, here are some reasons a brand manager is necessary.
What makes a brand manager so important?
Chances are that you fully understand the importance of a strong brand, but it’s not always clear how a brand manager helps achieve that. Here are some solid reasons to consider adding a brand manager to your team:
- They maintain brand consistency organization-wide. When we think of brand consistency, we often misunderstood the efforts a brand manager undertakes in order to uphold it. Though many employees work to boost and maintain the brand, their efforts would be flawed, scattered and weaker without a guiding force like a brand manager in charge of everything.
- They move the brand forward through innovative ideas. It’s important for a brand to evolve and not stagnate, but this isn’t possible without a dedicated person who works to come up with new ways to move forward. Often we forgot that upholding the brand is not the same as developing it or helping it improve. That’s why having a brand manager focus on these efforts is crucial.
- They protect the brand during times of errors or mistakes. Your brand will certainly have moments when it doesn’t look the best. Whether it’s just a minor error or a colossal mistake, having a brand manager who understands these situations and can set forth a plan to fix it is necessary.
Now that you have an idea why a brand manager is so helpful, let’s look at some unique abilities they need to possess in order to make a difference in their position.
5 dynamic skills brand managers should have
A brand manager needs to have certain qualities in order to achieve the things necessary to boost and maintain a brand. Here are five of the most important skills a brand manager should bring to a team.
1. An advanced ability to communicate
“In teamwork, silence isn’t golden, it’s deadly.” – Mark Sanborn
Successful brand managers communicate across many different departments and advocate company-wide cooperation on different projects. It’s important, then, to build solid relationships through good communication prior to beginning big projects. Here are some ways a brand manager might go about improving upon their communication skills.
First, they need to be visible and available as much as possible. This includes fielding questions from different departments, attending creative meetings and learning team workflows. They most importantly should show themselves as available for all types of brand questions as they arise.
Remember that brand consistency starts internally, so a brand manager should make it clear that they’ll help out with all necessary tasks and ideas concerning keeping branding up to standards.
2. A knack for creativity
“You can’t use up creativity. The more you use the more you have.” – Maya Angelou
Creative teams with strategic targets innovate the best brands. However, it is fair to say that too much structuring of these creatives hampers their innovation. Because of this, effective brand managers know to implement strategies that encourage creativity instead of restricting it.
One of the things that separates good and great brand managers is the ability to find the right balance between structure and innovation within their creative strategies. These processes should give their creative teams the chance to stay focused while boosting progress in fulfilling brand objectives. The key to this is a combination of prior planning and periodic intervention when necessary.
The best way to handle these processes and obtain the necessary skills to succeed is by outlining your expectations beforehand whenever creating a new brand asset or starting a new project. By putting these in writing and giving them tangible examples, they are quite clear and can be referred back to when necessary. Lastly, a good brand manager will have the understanding of when they should reiterate branding goals that encourage team creativity.
3. Quantitative reasoning
One of the most fundamental brand manager skills is the ability to apply reasoning to different forms of data relating to branding efforts. It’s important to note that many branding outcomes are understood qualitatively, but expressing them with analytics and numbers is what makes a brand manager so effective.
Part of this skill, particularly quantitative reasoning, is boosted by the ability to synchronize branding data and measuring branding reach before beginning new processes. A good brand manager should be able to calculate conversion rates to show how well new messaging is performing.
The final ability a brand manager needs in this regard is the skill to present gathered data in a unique, dynamic way that makes it engaging. This requires a refined presentation style which blends quantitative reasoning with real-world examples to further a data-driven case for branding activities.
4. The capacity to read trends
Brand managers need to be able to immerse into key markets in order to better grasp the type of presence their brand has in them. Being able to understand relevant marketing research gives managers insight into the different types of media their customers and potential customers consume, as well as the different conversations they’re engaged in. This gives the manager a chance to identify the types of brand messaging that will be effective.
This skill is dictated by how well a brand manager is able to gauge how compelling a brand’s messaging is from customer perspectives. They need to be able to obtain first-hand insight, which is much more valuable than something like customer surveys provide.
5. The ability to adapt
“Adaptability is being able to adjust to any situation at any given time.” – John Wooden
A basic skill all brand managers need is the ability to be flexible even when it seems difficult. Due to the potential market changes, the only way to move a brand forward is through adaptation. Whether it’s through some type of new design or powerful messaging, the manager needs to be able to create new opportunities without disregarding the core brand ideas.
Consider also that many conversations that relate to customer experiences with your brand happen in real time on social media platforms. It’s important, therefore, to have the flexibility to use social media correctly for branding campaigns. Finally, understanding brand discussions on these different platforms is important, and a strategy is required to adapt as these trends develop.
Now that you know what types of things a brand manager needs to be able to do, here are some ways they can boost their brand management.
Ways for a brand manager to improve brand management
One of the main tasks a brand manager faces is brand management, and each will have their own way of handling it. However, there are a couple things a manager can do to improve their results.
Implement internal software systems
Brand managers are tasked with handling many different branding issues, all while trying to innovate the brand further. As such, there’s bound to be some times when they need some extra help. When that’s the case, a software system is crucial.
The best types of software to improve brand management and ease the pressure off brand managers need to be able to handle different security tasks, branding processes and branding elements.
Outsourcing brand management tasks
Many brands outsource a lot of their brand management tasks to external agencies, but this doesn’t have to be a choice that excludes the use of a dedicated brand manager. In fact, the two can bolster each other.
Sometimes there are a few tasks that need to be handled by a professional, outside source so that the brand manager can handle other issues. When this is the case, finding a brand management agency has a lot of value.
Final thoughts
The reality of brands today is they are forced to react quickly to keep up with how often the market can change and how fast information is shared.
Brand managers must be willing to keep up with all types of discussions and information concerning their industry and their brand in order to truly succeed.

80,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-manifesto/,"A bold statement for all to see: A complete guide to build your own brand manifesto
December 24, 2020|
Throughout a brand’s ‘life’, there comes a time when its impact is too manufactured, too safe, too friendly and too status quo.
Some brands continue along these lines of safety, never shaking anything up or putting themselves out there for all to see. However, others say ‘bring it on’.
These bold brands then create a manifesto, and in doing so, make their brand into so much more.
This article will give you the necessary tools so that you can buck the normal and say bring it on.
What is a brand manifesto?
A brand manifesto is a written explanation of why a brand is necessary, what it stands for and what will drive it forward. It’s an empowering, emotional story or group of phrases that builds an emotional bond between brands and customers, by showing how that brand functions in terms of motivation to change lives for the better.
Writing a brand manifesto should be an exciting event that gives brands a chance to show audiences who they really are and inspire to be. Let’s make sure you have the right tools to succeed.
How to write a brand manifesto
The following strategies are designed to push your brand above and beyond the normal results of a standard brand manifesto. You just can’t settle for less.
1. It’s not just WHAT you say, it’s HOW you say it
Certainly, the power of a manifesto is in its message, but that message would be greatly diminished if it were written in the wrong tone or voice. There are a couple things to consider here in order to get your manifesto right.
First, the manifesto uses its language to unite audience and brand. They often speak to ‘you’, the audience, and they often speak as ‘we’, the brand, but in doing so, they make sure it is as if the brand and audience are on the same page, feeling the same things and working towards similar goals. A brand’s use of ‘we’ in the manifesto is only to indicate a uniting of themselves with their audience in something bigger than themselves.
Another thing to remember is that a manifesto thrives in the active voice. This isn’t a requirement, but you’ll understand why it makes sense to use the active vs passive voice in your manifesto. One particular reason is this makes the brand seem to believe in what they’re saying, as if they’re currently doing everything they believe in.
2. Include a mixture of elements
A manifesto without a diverse set of different elements will fail to deliver on its promise, which is to show brand’s true colors and inspire its target market. This isn’t to say that a manifesto should follow a set of rules or include so much of a certain element, but brands need a general guideline of what types of things to include.
First of all, a manifesto needs to inspire, as you know by now. It will struggle to do so without some type of hopeful message. It’s tough to be inspired by a depressing, helpless message, no matter how well they’re written.
Another element to include is the semblance of a story, regardless of how brief. These two elements should mix in with your brand’s values and philosophical ideals.
Of course, there will be other elements that you feel fit into your manifesto, but make sure you agree upon a foundation before branching out.
3. Make a commitment to authenticity
It’s easy to write a manifesto with inspiring words and ideas, but if your brand doesn’t fit with these values or lacks a clear direction, the manifesto will seem disingenuous. There needs to be an authentic connection between your brand and what’s being said in the manifesto. This isn’t always so easy to spot or fix, but enough effort will uncover the right balance.
An authentic manifesto is put forth by brands who give their audiences a reason to believe in them beyond a product or service offered. They explain the why, as in why they do what they do, and why they plan on pushing forward these beliefs in the future, alongside its customers. Once these concepts are settled, a brand’s manifesto can be put out for all to see without any shame or meekness, as it represents the truth.
4. If the impact is minimal, don’t bother
Most would think this would go without saying, but look at any manifesto for a successful brand – none of them are flat, dull or without ambition. A manifesto isn’t a way to show how a brand is great or how a product is high quality. It’s instead a chance to give audiences an idea of how their lives could align in a whole new way with the powerful ideals of this brand.
A manifesto should be a philosophical urging to push yourself in your own personal life, with the subtle idea that the brand is right alongside you, supporting you forward and mirroring your values so that together you’ll change the world.
5. Make your manifesto unpredictable
No one outside of your brand should be able to guess, within a reasonable closeness, what your manifesto will be. The idea that someone can predict your manifesto should scare you, because a brand’s manifesto isn’t meant to fit in line with its products, services or competitors. It is supposed to take a step outside comfortability and predictability and make a bold statement, declaring itself bigger than ever believed.
The point, as you have probably realized by now, is to avoid fitting in, or placed into a metaphorical box. You don’t have to promise the world or pretend you’re something you’re not, but there should be a surprising idea inside the manifesto. Make sure it blows customers away and lets them know you’re out to change the world, rather than sell a product.
Now let’s show you some example manifestos that I liked, and that clearly grasp the concept well.
Examples to guide your manifesto
The following examples show the true spirit of a brand manifesto, so consider their position in the market and within their industry, and attempt to emulate their success in your own unique way.
(RED)
Red is a nonprofit organization seeking to help end the AIDS epidemic. They sell products and use the proceeds to benefit anyone suffering from the disease across the planet. In order to differentiate from other nonprofits, they wrote a manifesto that boldly declared the unique ways they are different.
As you can see, (Red) has taken a stance with their manifesto, declaring that things are a certain way, then backing that up with their commitments. Furthermore, they show that they’re not the typical nonprofit, making mundane decisions. Instead, they’re changing the idea of what it is to help one another, and they are proud to share this idea with their audience.
Nike
Nike’s manifesto is an important one, because they’ve always been one of the first to challenge ideas about limitations and expectations of the human spirit. It’s a common theme throughout history to see someone surprise everyone by overcoming something seemingly impossible, and Nike capitalized on this phenomena in their manifesto through the lens of athletics.
Their idea was to offer hope to all who choose to believe, that they in fact could be the best at whatever they do, a ‘superstar’. By doing this, they pushed forth the message that their brand is for everyone, their products are for everyone and anyone who wants to try their hand, has a shot at becoming spectacular.
Apple
Apple has always put forth that they stand behind the idea to ‘think different’. Their products don’t adhere to this idea, and neither do their services, but that’s not the point of a manifesto. A manifesto doesn’t have to be related to what a brand sells in any way, it just needs to capture what the brand believes in and what it wants its audience to see in it.
You might notice right away that Apple’s manifesto deals in extremes, exaggerations and hyperbole. This is definitely true, but it works for them, because they were one of the first to do it. They had to find a way to break from the monotony and stand out, and this was their path. Your path will be different, but the example is still relevant.
Lastly, let’s make sure you firmly grasp the reason why a manifesto has true importance and look at a few other considerations.
Why a brand manifesto is so important
A manifesto can often act as a guiding force in important things such as hiring decisions, marketing campaign decisions and more. It’s more than a set of rules or guidelines for a brand, though. Instead, it’s a motivational statement that offers the heart and soul of a brand for all to see and encourages all involved to commit to it.
Having a brand without a well-manicured manifesto is similar to a chicken walking around with a blindfold over its eyes. That’s not to say that a manifesto is a strict instructional on how to move forward, but it offers a driving force to emotionally react to and bond with.
Other considerations
The following concepts should act as an underlying guide to your manifesto.
Stay within the true nature of your brand
In the world of branding, it’s common (and easy) to copy other brands. All too often, one brand sees another successful brand doing something a certain way and does the same. Sometimes this works, of course. Other times, like in the case of manifestos, it has the potential to make a brand look silly.
Normally, we don’t recommend restricting ourselves or holding back, but in the case of a manifesto, that might be good advice, depending on your brand’s personality, products or values. For example, it might work great for a brand to have a manifesto which sounds like they’re screaming it from the rooftops in its language and tone. However, the same manifesto would look goofy if used by a brand known for selling pillows or deodorant. Being inspiring and emotion-inducing is fantastic, but make sure to restrict your manifesto to the nature of your specific brand and what you do.
Should a manifesto be on display for all to see?
The final consideration in building a manifesto is determining who will see it? Again, all brands are different, and some will want it to be an internal-only piece. However, even if you’re one of these brands who has an internal manifesto, it should at least be considered to use the manifesto as a way to offer the outside world a look at your values.
The power of a public manifesto is it offers a chance for customers and potential customers to align themselves with your brand’s ideals. This can build brand loyalty when done correctly, so consider if it makes sense to aim your manifesto for your target market audience.
Closing thoughts
It’s too limiting, especially in modern times, for a brand to only exist to help customers with products they sell or services they provide. Their values and ideals have so much more for a customer to benefit from.
Manifestos show that a brand is willing to share their vision with customers, show that they think alike; that they think big.

81,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-persona/,"Brand persona – Humanize your company
January 7, 2020|
When your company interacts with customers, they reveal something about themselves as a business. This information all adds up and builds a brand persona. A brand persona influences the way customers behave toward companies, including when it comes time to make purchases or visit your website over others.
Do you know what type of brand persona your company is? Do you know why it’s important or how to create it?
What is a brand persona?
A brand persona is made up of different characteristics, values, and personality features. These traits all help companies open up to different customers in numerous ways. When a customer assigns human traits to a company, this is the sign of brand persona in action. A brand persona can be abstract, in the sense that customers create a human image of your brand in their heads when seeing your logo. It can also be more concrete, such as a logo or mascot.
What makes a good or effective brand persona?
A strong brand persona usually is relatable to a customer base and makes them feel as if your brand is just like them personality-wise. If you’re active, hard-working, outgoing, sympathetic, environmentally-aware or friendly, you want a company to mirror these traits.
With this in mind, aim your messaging and goals toward the people who would likely be willing to try your products. For example, if you are selling food products that are designed to be eaten on-the-go, you might try to construct something that embodies hard-working busy people that prioritize working and getting things done over sitting down and relaxing during a big meal. When customers think of your company like a mirror image of their character, they buy into the idea that the product you create is the right one for them.
Why do I need one?
Your brand persona gives your company a chance to have powerful relationships with customers. What will customers visualize when they see your logo and products or hear your jingle? Will yours be one that portrays the positive values, mission and goals of your company? Remember that if you fail to strive for the right identity, it’s inevitable that the wrong one will be bestowed upon you. Make sure you guide yours from day one.
To see how powerful it is for a company, imagine a young girl and her mother are shopping for volleyball equipment. They see two different brands are selling gear. One company represents a tough, hard-nosed athletic girl who fights to win every game. The other brand’s persona is absent and gives no insight into their brand identity. It seems obvious from this example that the right persona makes companies successful, especially over their competitors.
Creating distinct awareness and concrete understanding
It’s not always easy to know what your brand persona is. Fortunately, there are a few ways to work with your teams in order to better understand it. The easiest way to help everyone in your company visualize your persona is by having them imagine seeing a personified version of your brand. What would your brand look like if you closed your eyes and made them human? Would they be short, tall, rude, friendly, exciting, boring? Take these cues as hints to what you’re doing right or wrong and go from there.
Once your brand becomes more concrete, spread the ideal version of it across your company to ensure everyone continues to work towards spreading it at all times. The only way to maintain one is by having all team members aware of it.
Remember that your brand persona not only signifies important values of your company, it also helps customers choose you over your competitors. Keep this in mind as you build your future campaigns."
82,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-portal/,"Automate your digital asset sharing with brand portals
April 27, 2020|
A brand portal provides access to your company’s digital content internally and externally. Portals boost efficiency and promote healthy relationships with potential customers and current clients. If you’re not sure how a brand portal works or how it boosts companies, this guide will steer you in the right direction. Here’s a closer look at how they work, starting with a breakdown of what they are exactly.
What is a brand portal?
A brand portal is a complete digital storage center for digital assets. Portals allow companies to share important digital content with fellow team members or outside parties. They also offer secure sharing of valuable company guidelines and assets such as manuals, images and brochures.
Here’s an example to help you better visualize brand portals. It’s Halloween night and kids are ringing doorbells looking for candy – these kids are like company externals, such as journalists or students. The candy they want is like digital assets. If the homeowner answers the door each time the bell rings, they are behaving like a company without brand portals. However, if they place candy in a big bowl outside the front door with a sign that says ‘take one’, they’ve created a brand portal. Every outside source has access to what they need and the company isn’t obligated to find assets for anyone.
Here are some unique ways a brand portal helps companies:
Share faster with externals
As your company grows, it adds valuable digital content to a company image library. This content is useful to externals wishing to use it for a story, research or reference. The process of delivering these company assets to externals is overhauled with a brand portal, which allows access to authorized individuals. Once implemented, the clients can retrieve this content without any extra steps.
Not only does a brand portal increase the retrieval time for externals, it also decreases the amount of effort teams have to put into coordinating asset deliveries. This builds the company in multiple ways because externals can return for future access with ease. Furthermore, members of the company optimize their workdays through the use of portals.
Optimize internal brand processes
Brand portals boost internal brand processes by minimizing excess access to the content library. For example, if the finance department uses brand assets for documents they send out, they don’t want all the branding content. Instead, they simply need a few digital pieces. A brand portal solves this by giving them specific, limited access so they only get the content they need.
Brand portals give administrators the ability to oversee shared files within the portal. This ensures all brand material is being given out correctly and to the right people. The efficiency this creates optimizes not only brand asset management but also the entire day-to-day operations.
Increase accessibility
Brand portals need to be accessible for all access channels, especially mobile. The chances are high that externals are going to access brand portals using mobile devices. Ensure your brand company portal is versatile enough to fulfill its purpose without frustrations for externals. This requires, in particular, extensive mobile-accessible brand portals.
Mobile-friendly portals diversify not only the access points but also the externals seeking information through a multitude of devices. The portal should not only function on mobile devices, it should also be optimized aesthetically for mobile devices. The chances of continued portal use depend on the ability to make a functional, visually-pleasing portal that is mobile-available.
As your brand portal opens up content to externals, adjust it accordingly to handle every possible usage outcome. Make sure the process of retrieving digital content from your company is secure, efficient and convenient."

September 14, 2020|
Marketing your brand’s service is a task that requires company employees to be well aware of the brand’s foundational principles. However, sometimes keeping them informed is tricky.
Fortunately, this guide provides key templates and examples to lay the groundwork so that you can succeed.
Brand positioning is the way in which a company shows itself to be different in many ways from its competition. The brand positioning statement explains how they make this happen.
Before getting started with the statement templates and examples, let’s briefly break down the key concepts above.
What is brand positioning?
Brand positioning explains to customers the values, benefits and ideals of your specific brand. It is a complete strategy that implements different unique elements, such as a logo or slogan, to show why your business is better than the competition.
A brand positioning statement maintains a company’s brand values throughout projects, campaigns and other advertisements. It shows customers the type of brand you are and what kind of values you hold.
In order to build our own, let’s go over the basics of what a positioning statement is.
What is a positioning statement?
A brand positioning statement is how a brand ensures their marketing campaigns stay true to their core values. It reminds internals of the company’s audience, industry and more. It is usually a brief statement and is for internal use only.
Remember that a brand positioning statement benefits customers and clients, but this benefit is brought about by adherence to the statement from internals.
The customers and clients don’t actually get to see a positioning statement, and if they do, it wasn’t a necessity for the sake of its efficacy.
How to write a balanced positioning statement
“When positioning a brand, aggressively avoid becoming a “me too” by assertively being a “who else?” – Crystal Black Davis
The following principles should be followed in order to create a helpful statement.
- Create a structured overview of the statement. Before digging into the process, have a layout created that offers an overarching plan to what things will be included.
- Explain your brand differentiation. Give the ways your brand is unique and capable of offering something the competition does not.
- Locate the right market. Define your specific customers and make it clear how you plan to help them solve their issues.
- Keep it on the shorter side. Though we want the statement to be concise, don’t go overboard. A few sentences will cover the important stuff.
Let’s take a look at some famous brands who have managed to stand the test of time, and see what type of statements they could potentially employ. After that, we’ll look at some sample templates for you to use.

The first template example is in sentence/written form. I crafted this template with the core components each template needs, but there’s always going to be variance. Input your own elements if necessary. I’ll use both of these templates in my examples so you can see them in action.
Template 1
[Our company] is targeted toward [core customers] who want [what they want]. [Our company] offers [how you propose to give the customer what they want] and makes customers [how your company makes them feel].
Template 1 Example
Digital Library is targeted toward people who love reading who want less clutter. Digital Library offers unlimited online books in a central location and makes customers feel organized and in-control.
The above example demonstrates how well a brand positioning statement defines a company’s goals. It also gives hope that a brand can have materials marketed with its core values attached.
Note that the elements of the above template may not be best for your brand. Switch out whichever best helps construct your ideal positioning statement.
The second template is in table form, which gives brands a chance to create a bare bones outline for their statement. Note that I’ve changed some of the functional elements included from the first template, though these are just guidelines. Your template should differ depending on your brand.
Template 2
|For||Your target market|
|Our company||What we do specifically|
|Your problem||The customer’s main problem you can address|
|Our solution||How you plan on fixing their problem with your product or service|
|We have||What qualifies your brand as reputable|
Template 2 Example
|For||People in charge of their family’s grocery shopping|
|Our company||Sells groceries online|
|Your problem||Restricted travel/expenses/time|
|Our solution||Groceries come directly to you; prices are lower than mainstream stores; same day delivery|
|We have||Proven results over 25 years in the grocery industry|
Getting started
At the end of the day, a positioning statement acts the same way a visible to-do list does. They both inform you of what needs to happen in order for things to get done correctly.
When you need everyone on the same page, look no further than a positioning statement. Use the above examples to guide your path to success.

November 16, 2020|
At its core, a brand positioning statement maps out how a brand presents itself. However, in a more abstract sense, it also inspires and motivates all who read it.
How, then, should you build a statement that accomplishes the essentials while also furthering ambitions for your brand?
This guide answers this question and more. At the end of it, you’ll understand how to truly motivate with the help of a dynamic, descriptive statement. Let’s get started.
What is a brand positioning statement?
A brand positioning statement is a short, descriptive declaration distributed internally to provide standards to uphold brand consistency. It acts as a guide for employees to further understand brand goals. A brand positioning statement provides focus and clarity for a brand. It defines a target audience, categories and values.
A brand positioning statement is similar to an instruction manual for building a desk. Each part of the desk is important and contributes to the overall function of the completed construction. A brand positioning statement is essentially a step-by-step manual on getting each part of the desk fitted correctly so the end result is correct.
Now let’s get to the heart of the positioning statement: its purpose.
The main objective of the statement
“In a competitive crowded world market, it’s the well positioned brands that Stands Out!”– Bernard Kelvin Clive.
A brand positioning statement clearly defines a brand’s customers, audience and values by portraying its identity and other valued traits. It is a much broader statement than, say, the mission statement. However, it should still be focused in its own unique way.
The goal of your brand positioning statement should be to clarify what sort of product, services or even ideas you provide and who you are providing them to. Include how you propose to deliver these to customers and why it makes sense to choose you over other brands.
Now that you know what a positioning statement is, let’s dig into some pre-statement concepts to ensure the process is correctly mapped out.
How to write; before you begin
“When positioning a brand, aggressively avoid becoming a ‘me too’ by assertively being a “who else?” – Crystal Black Davis.
In order to have your brand positioning statement function correctly, there are some necessary steps to take before you start creating it. First, you’ll want to do some brainstorming to get a bigger picture of the concept, then map out a blueprint of the statement. This is similar to measuring something before putting a saw down on it to begin cutting.
The main point of this preparation is to ensure that you understand the basic core of the positioning statement before getting bogged down in exact words and phrasing.
Next, think about the different fundamental categories you want included in the statement. This way the different concepts will build off one another and flow together nicely.
Writing a positioning statement is ultimately like buying a car. You can’t get caught up in worrying about things like radio quality and seatbelts before you know if the car even starts and runs. It’s important to start with the big picture and decide what’s most important before putting pen to paper.
Once you’ve considered what’s at the core of your brand, you can start developing those concepts into a statement.Here are some crucial components to include.
5 key tips to effectively develop your statement
The following five tips will get your positioning statement working effectively, and ensure that it is representative of your brand.
1. Pain point into solution
A pain point is a problem that consumers currently have. Your brand is the potential solution. A positioning statement makes that clear, and reminds everyone working on your brand to focus on that message.
Pain points are an important aspect of brands, and they often go unnoticed by the market unless everyone involved with your teams works to promote clear messaging that addresses them..
2. Dive in-depth into the target market
A brand positioning statement should help pinpoint exactly the type of audience you wish to attract. That way, every project and marketing campaign will have the statement as a sort of launching pad to aim in the right direction. The key is to be direct and specific about how you frame it.
For example, instead of saying your brand targets ‘thirty-somethings who need a toothbrush,’ you could describe your audience as ‘millennials who want whiter teeth and fewer dental bills.’ The more detailed you make your statement, and the more it pinpoints the correct demographic, the better it will help all involved with the brand relay the main features and messages.
3. Bring out customer emotions
Believe it or not, many customers care more about how your brand delivers positive emotional improvements to their lives more than about the features you offer. Telling someone that your car will save their life is generally more impactful than pointing out it’s sporting a model T7432 airbag.
It’s important to assure them that as long as they are connected to your brand, they’ll feel in control, be inspired and/or stay safe. To do this, make sure your brand positioning statement pushes an appeal to emotions.
4. Keep it brief no matter what
No matter how well-crafted or important the information inside, an overly-detailed brand positioning statement will not be as effective as a brief one. Those consulting the statement need to be able to quickly understand it well enough to apply it to their work.
Of course, the statement should be impactful and powerful, but short and sweet is a philosophy that often brings impact and power. As such, keep your statement from expanding too much in length. Keep all parts of the statement brief and to the point. This will help the main idea of the statement be fulfilled.
5. Edit for clarity
Remember that your positioning statement will often act as a point of reference for your team. When someone is making a company judgment or completing some type of customer transaction or task, they should find your positioning statement helpful in making sure their approach measures up to it correctly.
That’s why it’s so important to be clear when crafting the statement, as it will be referred to during essential times. The idea here isn’t to restrict growth, but instead to act as an anchor that can be picked up and relocated when the time is right.
Final thoughts
A brand positioning statement doesn’t simply encourage optimized brand promotion,it demands it. Make absolutely certain that your statement reflects the right values at all times. The excitement and motivation it can bring to your team is worth the time and effort to get it right.

September 8, 2020|
When we look at popular companies, it’s impossible to ignore their brand strength. Sometimes these brands have become so powerful they warp the meaning of everyday things.
If someone told you, “Michael Jordan was the best Bull ever” you wouldn’t think of a giant horned animal at a rodeo.
It goes without saying that successful companies thrive by nurturing, analyzing and building their brand. Therefore, in order to succeed, you’ll need to construct a powerful brand.
So, how do we do this? One of the most effective ways is through brand positioning.
In this article, I’ll walk you through all there is to know about brand positioning, then provide you with unique strategies and ideas to improve your own.
What is brand positioning?
Brand positioning helps customers understand the values, ideals and benefits you want them to see when they think of your brand. Brand positioning goes beyond a catchy jingle or visually-stunning logo. Rather, it is a comprehensive strategy that shows your business is a notch above the rest.
Brand positioning creates a brand association in customer minds that urge them to perceive a brand in a positive manner.
Why is this so important? If we’re able to mold customer preferences however we please, this boosts things like sales and brand loyalty.
It has become increasingly more apparent that successful brands arise out of powerful, unique brand positioning campaigns.
To get started, you’ll need to create your own specific brand positioning. Here’s an easy guide to help you succeed.
Dynamic ways to build your brand positioning strategy
A lot of preparation goes into brand positioning. Use these carefully-constructed strategies in order to get the best results.
1. Learn what your customers want, then evaluate your brand’s capabilities
I’ll preface this by saying there will be things customers want that you can’t deliver on. Don’t be discouraged by this! Instead, focus on other issues you can help out with.
The first step in learning what your customers want is determining who they are. This is accomplished by researching your potential target market. Note that this research extends to current customers as well.
Once it’s clear who your target market is, determine what they want from a brand. Focus on the most common expectations across your audience.
Finally, take a step back to evaluate your brand’s capabilities pertaining to customer needs. If you’re able to meet them, you’re ready to move forward.
2. Evaluate your present brand positioning
Take a good look at how you are marketing your products or services. In what ways do they stand out from the market? If they don’t, what are some ways that they could? Deeply understanding your present brand positioning is the key to determining what steps to take next.
Because we’ve already analyzed and evaluated important target market details in step one, we now need to focus internally. Ask yourself the following questions:
- In what ways do we have an advantage over our direct competition?
- What are our brand values?
- What kind of tone or vibe does our brand circulate?
These are the questions that need to be answered in order to continue building a successful brand positioning strategy.
3. Analyze your competition – determine how they are utilizing brand positioning
“A horse never runs so fast as when he has other horses to catch up and outpace.” – Ovid
The first step in this process is to figure out who the competition is, if you don’t know already. It’s a good idea to do some quick research into this, even if you already have a good understanding of who your competition is. Sometimes a new company flies under your radar.
I won’t delve too deeply into how to find your direct competition, since it’s pretty obvious and doesn’t require much digging. However, I will point out that a few quick searches on different platforms or some basic customer research can give you a good idea.
Once you know who your competition is, it’s time to learn more about them. More importantly, figuring out how they’re positioning their brand.
This type of research should be extensive and give you unique insight into how to position your brand. It should include detailed analysis of what the competition is doing right and what they’re doing sloppily. It should also tell you how they’re presenting their brand to the market.
With this information, position your brand to capitalize on the places where competitors fail, and emulate the ways in which they succeed.
Lastly, don’t forget that this research should be dynamic. Your competition will adapt just as you do. Be ready to analyze any changes they make.
4. Construct a powerful, unique brand positioning statement
“In a competitive crowded world market, it’s the well positioned brands that Stands Out!” – Bernard Kelvin Clive
A brand positioning statement requires creativity and an understanding of what types of things work as a statement. Remember that this will only be beneficial to you if it stands out.
Before we go any further, let’s make sure you understand what a brand positioning statement is.
What is a brand positioning statement?
A brand positioning statement details what your brand does, the benefits it offers and the audience it markets to. This is summed up in a short statement, typically one or two sentences in length. Lastly, it is an internal, rather than an external, document.
The most common misconception about brand positioning statements is their internal use. Many accidentally mistaken a brand positioning statement with a brand slogan or catchphrase. Remember that this statement is intended to guide your internal brand efforts.
Here’s an exercise that demonstrates how important it is to give a concrete brand statement. Consider the following two imaginary brands attempted to describe their positioning statement in one word:
Brand A: ‘Positive’
Brand B: ‘Environmental’
Notice the major difference between the two? Brand A is too abstract and doesn’t really define their brand positioning (all brands consider themselves positive).
Brand B, on the other hand, gave a much more concrete idea of what their brand is about. Keep this example in mind going forward.
With all this considered, let’s dive into the foundational traits of a successful brand statement:
1) Connects with customers
This isn’t to say that a brand positioning statement will be seen by customers (it won’t). Rather, you are creating a position for all projects and campaigns (which will be seen by customers) to follow.
2) Is an achievable promise
Guaranteeing the moon is great, unless you’re unable to launch off the ground. Evaluate and determine your limitations before structuring your brand around an impossibility.
3) Breaks free from market mediocrity
Remember that your competition is coming up with a brand positioning statement of their own. If yours is too similar, none of the projects or campaigns will be unique or give positive separation.
5. Extend this brand positioning to all corners of your projects
Once you’ve conducted thorough research and created a brand positioning statement, it’s time to express it throughout each area of your brand. There should be traces of it in your brand persona, communications, products and more.
This takes a company-wide effort, but the benefits are worth it. Once it’s clear that the statement has an impact in each and every project, there’s one more thing that needs to take place: efficacy evaluation.
In order to see if your brand positioning statement is paying off, make sure to occasionally evaluate its overall impact with customers. Stay vigilant with this and adjust accordingly.
Now that you know how to construct a statement, here are some successful examples to guide you further in this process.
Helpful examples to consider
Whether it’s a total commitment to their values or a unique stance compared to their competitors, successful brands always seem to make the right type of impact.
Here are some examples that I find illustrative and helpful when learning about how to position a brand.
Apple
When you see an Apple advertisement, visit an Apple store or log on to their website, it’s apparent what type of traits the brand consistently represents. You would probably describe their messaging as creative, modern and simple.
More importantly, Apple positions its brand to connect with their customers, suggesting that those who purchase from them are innovators who prefer simplistic yet intricate products.
This shines through especially in their advertising, where it’s clear that Apple makes their customers and audience feel like they’re part of a unique club when using Apple gear.
Bumble
Dating apps left a bad impression in many users’ minds over the years. Despite the companies’ best intentions, dating apps have left users frustrated and wanting change.
Change arrived with Bumble, a dating app offering a totally new type of experience. Although still modern and packed with the typical features users loved, Bumble positioned its brand as one that was innovative and progressive.
It did this by limiting initial interaction, which reduced the potential for a barrage of unwanted messages from someone you’ve just recently connected with.
More notably, they challenged social stereotypes and antiquated norms by having women make the first contact before any other messages can be sent. This set the tone for the overall makeup of the Bumble experience for all users.
Starbucks
The popular coffee chain has gone above and beyond the normal realm of customer experience. It has become clear with the way Starbucks positioned their brand that they believe every customer interaction and experience is monumental.
The most surface-level example of this is writing the customer name on their cup, something that sets them apart, at least from other large chains. Less obvious are the continuous internal efforts to recreate the foundational reasons customers love(d) their stores.
Starbucks dedicated plenty of time, resources and effort to ensure their brand positioning shined through at each and every location. This is seen in their drive-thru structures, in-store designs and branded scents.
Lastly, here’s an example positioning statement I made for the popular automobile brand Tesla.
So, what are the takeaways from the above brands that we can use? One constant is the willingness of these successful, popular brands to take an alternative stance.
Similarly, we should look for ways to break free from the sameness other brands put forward.
One way to do this is with superior planning and strategizing. I’ll now give you some unique strategies designed to set you apart from competitors.
Key strategies to further yourself from the mundane
Your brand will only be as strong as the methods of branding you use to position it. Following an average guide will get you average results. Instead, you need strategies that break free from conventions and give your brand a boost.
Don’t compete when you don’t have to
“Companies that solely focus on competition will die. Those that focus on value creation will thrive.” – Edward de Bono
The reality of the market is there will be extensive competition. However, that doesn’t mean we have to get bloodied up and bruised fighting for that piece of the pie.
Sometimes it works a lot better to take a step back and find a smaller section we can have all to ourselves.
So how do we go about doing this? It all boils down to our overall focus. Instead of aiming our brand at a general market portion, we narrow our reach to its subsidiary sections.
Essentially, we’re creating value to a specific group within a mostly-deserted piece of the market. To do this successfully, it’s important to offer our brand as an answer to this group’s unmet requirements.
Remember, fighting for the bigger portions of the market is still important – we absolutely should target them. However, when there’s an opportunity to position ourselves to a niche group, it’s an underrated tactic to do so. Look for these chances in the future.
Take your visual elements a step further
“Create your own visual style… let it be unique for yourself and yet identifiable for others.” – Orson Welles
It goes without saying that visual elements are a big part of a successful brand. Things like digital graphics, flyers and logos boost campaigns and define projects.
However, creating these elements is only half the battle. Especially when it comes to brand positioning, a key path to success is maintaining visual integrity.
This is accomplished through analysis and re-evaluation of brand graphics throughout each project and campaign. Furthermore, there are different tools designed to help uphold visual element quality and relevancy.
Lastly, structure your maintenance so that it receives adequate review. This usually involves a consistent, scheduled process that ensures everything is looked over and brand elements are on point.
Pinpoint why your target market should pick your brand. Communicate this reason to everyone.
What are the unique benefits of your brand? What can it offer that others cannot? How do its products and services solve customer issues?
These are the questions you need to ask and answer to yourself. Armed with this insight, you’ll be able to communicate these unique advantages to customers.
Your ultimate goal here is to position your brand so that a spotlight shines on its best qualities – qualities that competitors can’t replicate.
This process clarifies the unique qualities your brand offers and makes brand positioning much more successful in all future endeavors.
The modern brand positioning map
Brand positioning is all about changing consumer perception, and getting a better sense of that perception is crucial.
The most effective way to do this is by creating a brand positioning map. This gives a visual layout of similar brands in respect to attributes and characteristics. Ultimately, it will inform you how customers perceive your brand compared to others.
As you can see from the pic above, a brand positioning map details how brands land on different traits, benefits and qualities.
In this example, which I created based on my own preferences, you can see that Reign energy drinks are healthy and inexpensive. Red Bull and Monster are less of a value and are unhealthy. Rockstar has good value but is unhealthy.
Each mapping you create should contain an axis of characteristics known to be important to your target market.
Including your competition takes some pride-swallowing in order to be accurate, but the future benefits are worth it. See where you are behind and where your competitors are ahead and you’ll be able to make changes.
Finally, don’t stop at one. There are plenty of things you can create a map for, so make sure you repeat this process until all aspects are accounted for.
Closing thoughts
It goes without saying that a strong brand is a difference-maker when it comes to success. Make sure to position your brand to reach your target audience in an impactful way.
Chances are, the more thought you put into brand positioning, the better your overall brand will be. Good luck!

86,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-recognition/,"From puzzled to positive: Putting your customers on a path to brand recognition
July 27, 2020|
We’d all like to be the only brand within a particular market, but that’s just not the case. However, it is possible to make it seem that way to your audience.
So, how do we do that? The key is brand recognition.
Any time a potential customer is contemplating a purchase, they think of your brand. Whenever they need a service that fits their requirements, again, they think of you – that’s brand recognition.
Without an effective effort to build recognition, a competing brand might pop into their heads. Let’s make sure it’s the former, not the latter.
What is brand recognition?
Brand recognition is when someone distinguishes a specific brand through identifiers such as color schemes, jingles, packaging or logos. The common denominator for brand recognition is a brand must be recognized before its name is directly given in any way.
Another way to help understand brand recognition is by thinking of it like this: if someone asks if you’ve ever heard of Apple, for example, and you have heard of them, this is not brand recognition.
However, if someone shows you the Apple logo and asks what brand that represents, and you know it’s Apple, that is brand recognition.
In this article, I’m going to explain ways that you can capture your target market so that they’ll recognize your brand when the time comes. The result will be greater success throughout each new campaign. Let’s get started.
Why should brands focus on building recognition?
Before breaking down some of the more important strategies about building recognition, it’s helpful to see all the reasons why it’s important laid out in front of us.
Increases their ability to charge more for products and/or services
“Pricing is actually pretty simple…Customers will not pay literally a penny more than the true value of the product.” – Ron Johnson
It seems strange, but good recognition does in fact allow brands to create larger profit margins on their products and services.
This is because recognition increases overall brand equity, which is the biggest reason why customers choose to spend more due to the brand behind the service.
Think of these two concepts, recognition and equity, as a convergence that amplifies the effects of both. When brand recognition is stronger, brand equity is stronger as a result, and vice-versa. The effect is compounding.
Because of this, the benefits of greater brand equity become benefits of brand recognition. Therefore, being able to charge more for products and services inflates as recognition increases.
Keeps your brand at the forefront of customers’ minds
It’s unlikely that your brand is the only one in a particular market. It’s also unlikely that you’re the only company, among your competitors, trying to boost brand recognition.
Strong recognition entices customers to think of your brand instead of a competing brand when they’re making a purchase.
That’s the power of brand recognition – it is a steady reminder that your brand has the service they want and need. Without it, a competing brand might pop into their heads.
There are other benefits of good brand recognition that are more abstract and less direct. As you continue to learn more about it, these will come into focus now and then.
Before I dig into some helpful strategies, I want to make sure you understand the difference between brand recognition and brand awareness.
A helpful breakdown of the difference between brand recognition and brand awareness
Though similar, there is a difference between recognition and awareness. Many people struggle to tell them apart, so I’ll break it down in a straightforward fashion. Once you understand it, building brand recognition becomes a lot easier.
As I pointed out earlier with my Apple example, recognition is the idea that people can identify a brand from different visual or audio indicators. Brand awareness is when a person knows that a brand exists.
You’ve probably seen components of brand recognition in action at some point of your life. For example, in some parts of the world, asking for a ‘Coke’ is the same as asking for a soda of any brand or flavor. Brand recognition allows a brand name to ingrain itself into common phrases and words.
Brand awareness is a much more nuanced part of branding. Customers who are brand aware have a greater understanding of your brand, further than simple recognition. They typically know that your brand products or services are the answer to their many needs and requirements.
Finally, brand awareness digs underneath the surface of a brand, showing its core values to its target market. This may make it seem more important than recognition, which is very surface-level, but they are simply different. One isn’t better than the other.
Despite their differences, the two concepts do build off each other, so keep that in mind as you learn how to better your recognition.
6 standout strategies to build brand recognition
I’ve come up with six approaches that are proven to create and maintain solid brand recognition. Embrace each method as a potential way to take your brand to new heights.
1. Start with brand consistency and keep it intact
It goes without saying that a brand is hard to recognize if it doesn’t adhere to some level of consistency. Changing a logo or name once might not be a big deal, but thirty times in a decade certainly would be.
Consistent brands on average have 30% higher revenue – which is reason alone to focus on it.
Consider a global restaurant brand. Certainly, if a customer walks into one of their restaurants, they expect the layout, color schemes and other identifiers to be consistent with ones from different locations.
Brand consistency aims to uphold certain values of a brand at all times. Failing to do so creates a disconnect between brand and its perceived ideals. If brand consistency isn’t met, there will be less reason for a customer to commit a brand to his or her memory.
For example, if you read about an exciting new brand that plans on being a family-friendly company, then fails to live up to this identity, you won’t likely take the time to commit their logo or jingle to your memory.
Creating brand consistency takes a company-wide effort, but is definitely worth it. The end result will be a much higher likelihood of brand recognition from your target market. Here are a few ways to build consistency:
- Develop a meaningful message
- Create and maintain visuals that matter
- Use a consistent tone
Finally, remember that consistency is an ongoing, dynamic process that requires extensive research and self-analysis to sustain.
2. Compose brand visuals that are impossible to tune out
“Create your own visual style… let it be unique for yourself and yet identifiable for others.” – Orson Welles
Visuals are usually the biggest factor in brand recognition. From color schemes, logos, design structures and more, they provide an easy way for customers to quickly identify a brand.
Accordingly, you’ll want to create visual elements that encourage recognition. Furthermore, these visuals should be used correctly on different campaigns.
Let’s take a look at some examples to demonstrate the types of visual elements conducive to building recognition.
Logos
A strong logo aids in recognition, even if it doesn’t include the name of the brand. For this to be true of your logo, it has to be in-line with the main message your brand expresses to its target market.
Let’s take a look at the Nike logo for a moment.
There are a couple things I want to point out here. The first is the swoosh underlining the text. Because Nike wants to be known as a brand for performance and athletics, the swoosh fits nicely. When people see the swoosh, they feel a sense of swift movement from the logo.
Next, consider the words themselves. First, consider the sharpness of the font. Each letter is crisp and bold. Imagine if the font was curvy and soft – the logo would be ineffective.
Also note the tension and movement in the text. The letters lean forward, as if preparing to bolt off the logo and run a mile.
When you combine all the unique individual factors that went into this logo, it’s a very strong visual element. Nike’s target market surely feels the logo relays the right message about the products Nike sells and what they represent.
Lastly, the above logo doesn’t really prove brand recognition, as the words are included. However, consider the following image:
Because of the consistent visual schemes such as color and design, people recognize this as the Nike logo.
Ensure that your logo speaks to your target market the same way Nike’s does. Consider if customers would recognize it as yours, even if there are no words.
Color schemes
Did you know that repetition of specific colors on visual components increases brand recognition by close to 90%? It’s true. If ten people saw your visual elements without any color schemes, and three of them recognized your brand, that means nearly six would have recognized it had color schemes been present.
Colors are a powerful tool for brand recognition because they evoke emotions, which return upon seeing similar colors in the future.
Consider the British oil company bp’s color schemes.
Clearly, they wanted to emphasize green, with a mostly-green logo and fully-green text.
Green typically brings up different feelings about nature (green trees, fields, grass, etc.) which is important for bp, considering their connection with the Earth and the fact they use its resources.
Whether bp is doing good for the environment or not isn’t the point – the point is that they’re using color schemes to propose that they are; or at the very least to suggest that they care.
If you’re not sure which colors would fit your brand, don’t worry. There are plenty of resources to guide you in the right direction, including this quiz that provides sophisticated answers about colors.
Visual consistency
Finally, the underlying principle that brings all these visual element concepts together is the idea that visible attributes must adhere to at least some level of consistency.
This entails using the same color schemes, fonts and logos throughout different campaigns, projects and advertisements.
There can be some differentiation, but it must be done within reason. If a nationwide brand has some of their store interiors painted completely white while others are green, it’s not going to breed recognition.
Consider the following Amazon logos:
They are completely different yet within reason. The usage of one or the other on different newsletters would be mostly unnoticeable and still boost recognition.
Compare that to the following:
Clearly this would be different to the point of detriment. Consistency should always be followed, at least to a reasonable extent.
3. Create loud audio without the high volume
Sounds, especially music, have a powerful influence over people’s emotions. So much so, in fact, that neglecting to use them when possible in your branding could result in missing out on numerous customer connections.
Does this mean you have to be a musical genius or hire a brilliant musician in order to create a comprehensive jingle? Of course not. There are plenty of brands who use a simple audio bit that captivates millions.
For example, consider the Intel jingle. The five-syllable tune has become iconic and is even available in sheet music on display at the Intel museum. Just seeing the Intel logo often elicits a memory of the jingle. See if you can hear it just by looking at the image below:
Visuals definitely still reign supreme when it comes to branding, but consider the evolution of sound, especially recently. People are now getting information from audio instead of text in a lot of their daily tasks.
For example, instead of logging onto a computer to research the weather, someone might now ask Siri (Google) or Alexa (Amazon) to tell them the weather.
It’s clear that audio is trending, so make sure the sounds you use are memorable in some way while adhering to brand values.
One way to do this is consider the tempo of a jingle or the strength of a sound. For example, if you are a yoga brand, a slow, soft peaceful jingle would be best. If you’re an athletic performance brand, a fast, powerful tune would work.
4. Concentrate on the people part of social media
Part of being seen is putting yourself out there. With all the different social media sites available today, it takes a more wide-scale effort to put your brand in the public eye consistently.
If nothing else, getting your visual elements onto different social media sites is a step toward brand recognition, though obviously this is only a small piece of the puzzle.
One of the most successful social media brands is GoPro, a brand that encourages users to post their stories online.
Connecting with users on many different platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, GoPro makes it easy to see why their products are so unique.
Part of the reason they have so many followers is the diversity in their footage. GoPro creates stories from all different locations and events, from oceans to backyards.
So how can you go about using social media to increase your recognition? Start by following trends and utilizing sites that would be a good match for your specific image and values. Then, look for creative ways to build community involvement and make interactions open-ended.
5. Put public relations to use for your brand
Just like with the above concept of social media, PR is an essential way to get your brand in front of its target market, which boosts recognition potential.
PR campaigns are popular and effective because of how easy and economical they are. However, just because they’re straightforward doesn’t mean you have to restrict creativity to enhance your campaign.
Consider how you can attract positive focus onto your brands unique traits, values and characteristics. This often leads to publicizing lighthearted articles about memorable brand moments throughout history.
Don’t be afraid to share exciting developments about your brand! Chances are, customers want to hear about it and would appreciate the information showing up in their go-to sources.
Lastly, remember that the effort of spreading the good news about your brand doesn’t have to be yours alone. There are agencies dedicated to establishing and perpetuating PR that is sure to keep you in the spotlight.
6. Command customer focus using email newsletters and blog posts
If you haven’t noticed by now, a common theme among these strategies is to put our brand in front of target markets as much as possible in a meaningful way.
Here are a couple ways to accomplish this. First, entertain the idea of implementing a periodic email newsletter. Next, build a blog to give your audience a way to connect further with your brand.
Crafting email newsletters
By 2024, it’s estimated that about 5 billion users will have an email account. We won’t be targeting all 5 billion (hopefully), but it helps to gauge the importance and growth of the digital tool.
Let’s start by getting an effective email newsletter set up. In order for this to be successful, the content will have to be inviting. So where should we place the most of our focus? Though it’s a little surprising, the headline is more important than anything else, so let’s start there.
In order to create a strong email newsletter, the headline has to be perfect: intriguing, relevant, genuine, actionable, etc. Gone are the days when this type of headline ‘worked’: “(no subject)”.
There are plenty of good resources for building a powerful headline. Here are a few tips that I’ve found to be effective:
- You’re not talking to a friend or relative, but a headline can still be personalized
- Be effective without being lengthy
- Avoid spammy/salesy language
- Don’t cheapen the message with slimy tactics (all caps, weird symbols, exaggerated tones, etc.)
Next up is the content of the emails. First things first: offering a sale of some sort is okay, but only if done in moderation.
For example, let’s say you send one email newsletter per month. It would be reasonable to only include some type of offer or suggestion for a purchase two times per year. This prevents our newsletters from turning customers off.
As far as the structure is concerned, it will be in your best interest to use some type of template software, since it’s likely you’ll have to send out a lot of professional newsletters. BeeFree has some unique designs you might wanna check out.
Finally, we need to create content that keeps our brand on the customers minds and ensures they won’t click ‘delete’ on our next newsletter. Here are the most important details to consider including when building your emails:
Structure and readability. An email is no different from a webpage design. If it’s annoying, unsightly or distracting, users will click off of it.
Practicality. Think about what the readers might get out of the newsletter. If they won’t learn anything helpful, add more content.
Personalization. Even if only slightly, most readers prefer a newsletter to have some form of personalized content that is exclusive to them.
Last of all, ensure each newsletter has consistent branding, with possibly a logo in every message, so long as it’s not intrusive to the content.
Build a blog
A blog is a chance to boost authority and provide content to your target market. Like a newsletter, it provides updates of ongoing developments while keeping a brand in view for customers.
Use blog posts as a chance to answer questions your target market may have and show yourself to be a reliable source of information in a certain industry or on particular topics.
These are some ways to make sure your blog connects with customers:
Keep a semi-strict publishing schedule. The readers will expect some type of adherence to a publishing schedule, though this can be somewhat flexible. The only time where it needs to be completely strict is if you promise certain publication dates.
Cater content to your specific audience. Sure, it’s great to pick up new readers from time-to-time, but our blog should mostly be relevant to our target audience.
Value quality over quantity. It doesn’t do much good to pump out a bunch of articles if they don’t really address the topic with any substance. Even if it means creating less content, make sure it’s of the highest quality possible.
Follow your brand style guide. This is especially important for building recognition. If the blog content differs from other areas of your website, it’s going to create a disconnect between your brand and customers. Make sure you stick to the brand style guide.
Research each article in-depth. Doing some serious research into each article and the keywords involved is crucial for a blog. Otherwise, you’ll end up creating a piece that doesn’t have any purpose existing. Tools like ahrefs are great for digging into keyword analysis.
Now that you have some clear strategies to boost your brand recognition, we’ll examine some examples of brands who create amazing recognition in unique ways.
Examples of brands who did it well
The following brands all command exceptional recognition due to a lot of unique factors that are definitely worth exploring further.
Disney
Disney has used powerful marketing strategies throughout the years to create a brand recognizable by just about everyone.
The experiences, consistency, visuals and audio indications all feed into the end result, which is the fact that most people can pick out Mickey Mouse’s ears from a drawing, or his voice from an audio clip.
More recently, they’ve used this to expand into different markets, creating products and offering services that tackle things Disney never used to be involved with.
Just like with Nike, Google uses its name as text within its flagship logo. For this reason, it’s fair to say that recognition doesn’t apply. However, consider the following subsidiary logos and symbols:
Would you be able to recognize these as Google? I believe you, and most everyone, would be able to.
Clearly Google has done something right, building its platform and creating memorable connections with users, so much so that it’s easy to identify subtle brand features as Google.
Apple
Apple is one of the most recognizable brands around. It’s pretty amazing to look through a few of their previous campaigns, because for whatever reason, they’re each so instantly identifiable as Apple.
Look at the following picture, for example:
It doesn’t say the word ‘apple’ or have any visible logos. It also doesn’t use the color schemes of the brand. However, people instantly know it as Apple.
This type of success is what we’re building toward. If you can get audiences noticing, you’re on the right track.
Get underway
I’m confident that the above strategies will help your target market recognize you easily.
Now it’s time to make it happen. Win your audience over by implementing these methods and adhering to these examples.
There’s no reason why brand recognition can’t be a reality for you.

January 29, 2016|
Brand image and brand reputation are sometimes mistaken for being the same thing. It’s understandable, given how a change in one could have a similar effect on the other. The difference between brand image and brand reputation is brand image is ‘customer-centric’ – the customer’s perception of the company determines brand strength. Brand reputation is ‘company-centric’ – it’s built around corporate actions and stakeholder interest. Companies want to have their image and reputation benefit from each other, but if one starts to falter, the other could follow suit. Here are five practices to uphold your brand reputation.
Ensure brand consistency
Brand consistency is crucial for managing perceptions, preventing confusion, and conveying the correct attitude. Consistency increases the chances customers will see your company as trustworthy or dependable. For example, a security company with mandated uniforms of suits and ties eases customer reservations better than a security company with no dress code. Furthermore, an advertisement by the same company showing uniformed guards protecting a home is going to put the company into the audience’s mind before a logo or slogan is seen or used.
Consistency goes beyond conveying professionalism, as it strengthens trust between consumers and companies. Marketing campaigns that focus on maintaining a basic level of brand consistency in each project are rewarded with a bond between themselves and their audience. Once consumer loyalty is built, future campaigns need only subtle reminders of the consistent brand markers (color schemes, layouts) to keep an audience engaged.
Establish and increase brand visibility
Establishing visibility is necessary for building reputation. There are a few ways to successfully accomplish this. The first way is through effective SEO practices. SEO-driven content will put your work into position to reach key audience groups and drive traffic to your website. Another way to increase brand visibility is widen the scope of company content. Writing articles for numerous publications and on different mediums gives your company’s outreach a considerable boost.
Think of visibility as a process that likely won’t help much in the short term. Everything done to increase visibility is aimed to funnel attention back to your brand. Creative engagement is crucial, as chances are you might be reaching out to audiences not normally familiar with your brand. Explore as many relevant avenues as possible to branch out and build brand visibility.
Continuous company evaluation
Take advantage of analytic evaluations to gauge production and success. The evaluations also give insight of the company to outside observers such as stakeholders. Schedule reports that will determine if your company is heading in the right direction, or if it needs to make changes. Gauge levels of inclusiveness throughout your organization periodically. Engagement is a big proponent of successful brand reputation.
Company evaluation isn’t exclusive to internal reflection, either. Reach out to audiences from time-to-time to get outsider feedback on how your brand is making people feel. New ways to get valuable feedback are created often. Most importantly, people love to be heard, so don’t think it will be difficult to obtain important insight.
Repair brand reputation
Repair brand reputation by attacking the heart of the issues. Research where the brand is lagging behind, and make changes when necessary. Stay connected with customers during the process to avoid further brand reputation damage. Analysis and reports are your best friend when searching for the reasons a brand is failing. Stay vigilant and patient as your company works to repair its reputation.
After correcting issues that led to poor brand performance, seek out ways to avoid similar mistakes in the future. Sometimes it can be tricky to determine if the failed campaign was due to something specific or a general problem. Change future projects to reflect new beginnings of your brand so that audiences feel things are different this time around.
Promote brand transparency
There are a lot of opportunities to reveal positive traits about your company to customers, but the strategy and implementation can be tricky. Create an outline before taking on the issue, and assign the right team members to handle certain efforts. For example, social media is a great way to give your company personality and voice. It also provides a chance to be open and communicative with customers. Ensure the correct team members are working to be transparent and open on social media and other mediums.
It sounds a little strange, but make sure you are transparent about your brand transparency. Inform consumers that your company is transparent about everything, or that you were in past situations. It signals to customers that in the future, you’ll be just as open with them as well.
There are so many ways to increase brand reputation, so focus in on ways to boost it without being overwhelmed. Coordinate tasks that galvanize brand reputation while staying true to company values."

August 19, 2020|
Brand resonance is like the very top of a skyscraper – a towering building high in the sky. You can’t expect to reach it by jumping or climbing up a small ladder.
Instead, it takes incremental steps, generally beginning with entering a building then working your way up many flights of stairs. Only then can you reach the top of a skyscraper.
Achieving brand resonance without some legwork is like jumping as high as you can into the air hoping to reach the top of the skyscraper.
Luckily, just like with climbing a tall building, there are some well-known steps listed in a model to reach resonance.
In this article, I’ll provide you with these steps, making it clear and simple to achieve brand resonance.
What is brand resonance?
Brand resonance is how well a customer relates to a branded element, such as a retail product. It is how someone perceives a brand and their values or goals. Brand resonance models are used to help build relationships with customers.
Now that you know what brand resonance is, it’s time to learn how to achieve it. This is where we introduce the Keller Model.
The Keller Model is widely observed, and lists the following steps on its pyramid structure:
- Salience
- Performance
- Imagery
- Judgments
- Feelings
- Resonance
I will break each one down in detail, but for now just understand that each offer guidance into what goes into each branding stage in order to reach resonance.
What is the purpose of a brand resonance model?
“It has been said that 80% of what people learn is visual.” – Allen Klein.
A brand resonance model details each necessary branding step required in order to reach resonance.
It offers a way for branding planning to take an illustrative effect, giving visual directions to reach important goals.
Unlike a linear model, which might suit other goals, a pyramid is best for brand resonance, as the quest isn’t linear and involves steps that involve different development procedures.
By having a visual structure, a brand can aim to achieve different branding objectives for their own unique products and services. I will provide a detailed example a bit later, but first I’ll break down each quadrant of the resonance pyramid.
The brand resonance model explained in detail
Understanding a brand resonance model is simple. In fact, you probably already know a lot about some of the steps.
There are four levels and six quadrants. The four levels essentially define a brand using these questions (from bottom – 1st rung of pyramid – to top):
1. Who are you? (Identity)
2. What are you? (Meaning)
3. What about you? (Response)
4. What about you and me? (Relationships)
These questions work brands through each stage of development. Tied to these stages is an objective aimed to help complete the task at hand. They are as follows:
1. Brand awareness
2. Differentiation
3. Emotional reactions
4. Loyalty
Let’s get started.
There’s no reason to overcomplicate the process – simply move from the bottom of the illustration to the top.
As we mentioned before, the model isn’t linear. However, there is some semblance of order that needs to be followed, beginning with the bottom level, ‘salience’ (noticeable, clear, identifiable).
Salience
What is it?
As you can see above, ‘salience’ fills up the bottom rung of the pyramid. Salience is simply referring to how transparent a brand is to a customer.
Brand salience deals with how knowledgeable a customer is about a branded product or service.
Similarly, each time a customer decides to make a purchase from a brand, salience is how clearly they can recall different factors such as values.
How to achieve it
The main thing to consider when fulfilling this stage of the resonance pyramid is brand awareness.
If you recall, this is the ‘who are you?’ stage of the model, and nothing answers that question better than strong brand awareness.
Brand awareness is, basically, how well a customer is able to identify particular traits of a specific brand, such as their unique qualities.
To increase your brand awareness, and thus answer the ‘who are you’ salience stage of the resonance model:
- Define your brand in detail
- Maintain steady focus on content
- Get creative with communication
The more you build brand awareness, the better you’ll answer the ‘who are you?’ question, which ultimately is the key to reaching salience.
Performance
What is it?
The ‘performance’ section is one of the two quadrants on the second rung of the pyramid. On a foundational level, performance in this case refers to how well a brand meets customer needs.
It is a measurement of efficiency, involving the products or services and how well they are helping customers overcome problems.
How to achieve it
The ‘performance’ quadrant is on the second rung of the pyramid, which means it is in the ‘what are you?’ stage of the model.
One of the most powerful ways to measure performance and efficiency is through differentiation, which gives us a reference point between a brand and its competitors.
In order to meet the objectives of the ‘performance’ stage, build brand differentiation by doing the following:
- Creating memorable experiences
- Displaying positive brand values
- Telling important brand stories
- Building brand personas
Creating differentiation helps answer the ‘what are you?’ stage, but remember that performance is only one of the quadrants of this stage. The other is imagery.
Imagery
What is it?
Imagery is on the second rung of the pyramid, sharing this rung with ‘performance’ and part of the ‘what are you?’ stage.
Imagery, in this model, refers to how the customer perceives a brand.
How to achieve it
Don’t confuse imagery with things like logos and fonts, though these may be a part of it. Instead, consider imagery to be more about customer perception and brand image.
Brand image deals with the types of feelings a customer has about a brand. In order to create a positive brand image, you’ll need to do the following:
- Learn more about your audience
- Use fitting visual elements
- Measure your personas to see if they relay the right message
With a strong brand image, you’ll move on to the next stage, ‘judgments’.
Judgments
What is it?
‘Judgments’ is on the third rung of the resonance pyramid, which is split between two different quadrants (the other being ‘feelings’).
Judgments in this respect refers to a group of thoughts and decisions a customer makes concerning a brand’s product or service.
Judgments refer to how customers feel about a product’s quality and ability to outperform other brand’s products.
How to achieve it
As ‘judgments’ appears on the third rung, it is part of the ‘what about you?’ stage of the resonance model.
In order to influence customers to hold positive judgments about your brand, determine new and unique ways to improve the performance and quality of your products.
The other half of this rung comes from the ‘feelings’ quadrant.
Feelings
What is it?
‘Feelings’ shares the third rung with the ‘judgments’ quadrant, making it a part of the ‘what about you?’ stage of the model.
Feelings, at least in this regard, means the amount of attachment customers have towards a brand.
How to achieve it
There are many ways to fuel customer emotions through your branding, though one method seems to stand out – brand experience.
Offering strong brand experiences builds relationships, memories and positive emotions. Here’s how to make sure your brand offers effective experiences:
- Target different human senses
- Personalize the experience
- Create emotional content
After working through the first three rungs, you’ll finally come to the resonance stage.
Resonance
What is it?
The resonance stage is the absolute top of the pyramid. Each quadrant below has built toward this: a solid relationship between brand and customer.
How to achieve it
As we’ve already shown, working through the bottom stages of the pyramid build toward resonance. In order to maintain it, however, focus on the things that sustain it.
For example, brand loyalty is a common result of reaching brand resonance. In order to maintain customer loyalty, do the following:
- Focus on customer support
- Enhance your customer service
- Offer rewards programs
- Adapt to consumer trends
Closing thoughts
A resonance model helps brands pinpoint their current location, making it clear what they need to do next to move up the ‘rungs’.
Once you become aware of a stage and the branding objectives required, the rest of the process is easy.

89,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-safety/,"An effective, creative approach to brand safety in 2021
December 15, 2020|
The growth of digital advertising possibilities creates risks that devastate brands and their reputation. As brands become more vulnerable to instant negative feedback and reactions, the need for brand safety is at its peak.
But there’s no need to live in fear. This focused, creative and easy-to-follow approach will elevate your brand safety without sacrificing your outreach.
What is brand safety?
Brand safety is a group of calculated procedures intended to uphold the integrity and image of a brand, particularly when the brand is practicing digital advertising. Brand safety often refers to how brands react to the location their ads land and what type of content they’re involved with.
Just as important as knowing what brand safety is, is understanding why it’s so valuable.
What are the dangers it prevents?
There are endless potential dangers brands face, especially considering the landscape of the digital world.
There is also a high likelihood that new dangers will develop as time passes, creating situations where brand safety will need to be reevaluated.
However, here are some of the most prevalent and avoidable dangers brands face today.
Advertisement proximity mishaps
This refers to the idea that your ad space and advertising message could appear next to an image, headline or story that in some way contradicts your ad or is a strange pairing.
For example, if there is a story about someone’s pet cow dying, and how sad it is, it would be an unfortunate advertisement proximity if a ‘Got Milk’ campaign ad showed up alongside it on the webpage.
There are times when it might be funny instead of awkward or crude, but even when it’s humorous, it still negatively affects your brand. Audiences aren’t very forgiving, either.
Negative brand associations
The next potential concern is that your brand will gain an unfavorable brand association. If brand safety isn’t evaluated and implemented, there’s a high likelihood that your brand could fall victim to negative associations by way of an advertisement being associated with negative material.
This is often the case when brand’s advertisements get mixed in with questionable groups with unlawful ideas. The association is hard to shake, and leaves audiences wondering why a brand would endorse that (even though it was just a mistake, not an intentional endorsement).
Now that you’re aware of how devastating the consequences of unprotected brands can be, let’s go into some of the most helpful tips available to ensure brand safety.
5 tips for better brand safety
It’s clear that you need some type of plan to tackle brand safety. These five helpful hints give you some unique ideas that are both effective and efficient.
1. Start off on the right foot
The best way to curb any potential brand dangers is to put yourself on the right track from the get-go. This process involves a comprehensive review and analysis of your brand, including its values. This helps you understand what types of situations you want to avoid.
After reviewing the brand, you’ll have a good idea of where your outreach might run into issues. Now comes the most important part, which is ensuring the settings of your campaigns on different advertising platforms are optimized for brand safety.
For this setup to be successful, consider the platform and their policy/history. Facebook and Twitter might have different built-in brand safety measures than LinkedIn or Instagram, for example. Once you understand the platform’s standard practices, you can adjust the settings and options to your liking.
2. Avoid brand safety software systems
Many brands make the mistake of believing they can remove themselves from the process of brand safety by implementing a software system designed to handle it for them. Unfortunately, this leaves them with an ineffective methodology, where a tool is over-correcting, under-correcting or incorrectly adjusting to accommodate brand safety.
There are two main reasons why a brand safety software system is likely to be detrimental to your brand. First, even the most advanced of these systems currently available aren’t the ‘smartest’ technology, and they cannot differentiate between simple changes and adjustments. For example, it’s not difficult for different websites to work around these systems restrictions through simple manipulation of blocked URLs and keywords.
Second, the correction these tools make is commonly an over-correction which is devastating to your brand’s outreach. For example, the machine will mindlessly block your ads from appearing on sites that have common words it deems to be ‘bad’, but in fact don’t have to be a negative, or may have multiple meanings.
You can imagine how frustrating it would be if your ads didn’t show up in an otherwise perfect location because the content on that site included the word ‘alcohol’, which was flagged. However, the site wasn’t promoting the use of alcoholic beverages, but was in fact referencing rubbing alcohol.
It becomes clear quite quickly that these technologies are lagging far behind in what is acceptable for brands to implement to encourage brand safety.
3. Get as specific as you can for your brand
In the above example, I showed why a software system is ineffective at promoting brand safety. The reason these types of tools fail is they don’t adhere to the idea that brand safety differs from one brand to the next.
Just because one brand finds something offensive, doesn’t mean another brand will. And, just because one brand’s products and services don’t work next to certain content, doesn’t mean another brand’s can’t.
Here’s an example to demonstrate. Apple and Microsoft have very similar brands, with products in the same industry. There is plenty of overlap there. However, if Microsoft found one of their ads on a site for an apple orchard, their reaction would be much different than if Apple found one there.
This example shows why it’s so important to tailor your brand safety measures specifically for you. Even brands in the same industry with near-identical products will have completely different processes, as you can see from the Apple example above.
4. Use analytics, intuition and data in unison
The key to a lot of brand safety preparation is balance. We can’t be everywhere at once, and we certainly can’t foresee everything. All we can do is take the necessary steps to minimize any potential damage while giving ourselves the best chance to extend our outreach.
To reach a happy medium and find balance in brand safety measurements, it takes a combination of analytics, intuition and data research. Bringing all that information together will help you make a final decision about what route to take.
For example, if one platform has the biggest outreach but also the most potential unwanted pieces of content, it will take extensive research and insight into how far your brand is willing to put itself out there on this platform. The same can be said for platforms that have zero inappropriate content but lesser outreach. Find your brand’s level of willingness to go one way or the other.
5. Involve yourself in the advertisement purchasing process
To ensure brand safety, it’s possible to monitor the purchasing process of ads. This allows you to get information from different publishers and check to make sure they’re safe, fair and in line with what your brand wants to promote.
Think of this like cutting out the middle person in your entire advertisement purchasing process. You are able to go directly to the source and remove any uncertainty involving what types of publishers will be handling your ads. This is more time-consuming, but the tradeoffs might be worth it. It all depends on your brand, budget, schedule and how much of a risk you’re willing to take by trusting a third party to handle your ads.
The above tips are sure to guide your brand through murky advertising waters and keep it safe. Now let’s make sure you understand a similar concept, brand suitability.
Where does brand suitability enter into the equation?
You’ve probably heard about brand suitability, especially when the conversation surrounding brand safety is underway. Brand suitability is simply a subcategory of brand safety. It is a way for brands to be more fluid in their brand safety measures.
For example, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, which might suit most but not all, brand suitability implies a dynamic approach to brand safety. This approach includes being more specific and personalized in how advertisements will appear and where.
It makes for a more effective brand safety approach that leaves open the possibility of further outreach. The downside, of course, is the immense effort this will take over the long run.
Finally, let’s touch on how brand safety will change and need to be handled in the future.
Brand safety in the near future
I won’t pretend that I can predict the future any more than anyone else can. I can, however, look at trends and make predictions based on these trends, which help us prepare somewhat for a possible future.
The first thing to point out is the recent uptick in digital, especially because of the pandemic. It’s hard to tell if this move will be permanent, but it’s clear that it will stick for some brands more than others. As this is the case, the idea of brand safety becomes more immense and requires more thoughtful input.
The other thing to note is the trends concerning how people consume things like audio, video and other content. Brands didn’t have to worry about brand safety in terms of a record or cassette tape, but now that music is a largely streamed enterprise, safety comes into play with advertisements. It seems unlikely this trend will disappear any time soon, so continue to be diligent in this area.
Finally, there is a paradoxical idea that brand safety can harm a brand, since safety measures can block ‘safe’ advertising spaces accidentally. Though this is a possibility, the more involved you are in the brand safety process, the less likely this is to happen.
Closing thoughts
When considering the digital advertising industry, it’s clear that it’s anything but static. There are constant shifts that change the way users are targeted, and how the users consume content. In order to uphold brand safety during these changes, it must improve upon itself as much as possible.
Fortunately, the evolution of digital advertising has brought about responses from these publishers who are willing to provide options for brands to secure themselves. If you take advantage of the features available, your brand will remain protected.

90,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-slogans-and-taglines/,"Understanding the ins and outs of brand slogans and taglines
December 3, 2020|
What makes brand slogans and taglines so catchy and memorable? Many people believe it’s because we associate them with well-known brands that offer quality products and services.
However, brand slogans and taglines can be memorable whether the brand they represent is successful or not.
The power of these elements is that they have a self-contained appeal with a lasting effect. The slogan or tagline makes the brand more recognizable, not the other way around.
Creating an impactful brand slogan or tagline requires a creative, strategic approach. This article will walk you through what makes a great slogan or tagline. After all, it might just be the thing people remember most about your brand, so let’s make sure it’s effective.
What is a brand slogan?
A brand slogan is a brief phrase or motto that convinces a target audience to buy a product or service, or to believe in something special. Slogans are a simple and effective way to help customers identify a specific brand.
It’s fair to say that the atmosphere and energy of a brand is often captured in a slogan, no matter how brief it may be.
We will break down how to build slogans, as well as how they differ from taglines. But first, let’s make sure you have a solid understanding of brand taglines as well.
What is a brand tagline?
A brand tagline is a set phrase that succinctly conveys a brand’s identity. Successful taglines give off a powerful effect to anyone who reads or hears them. They are often helpful in advertising campaigns and when building up company branding.
Since a slogan and tagline seem so similar, it’s easy to get them confused. Here’s a breakdown of how they are different.
What are the main differences between a slogan and tagline?
It’s quite common for the average person to believe a slogan and tagline are the same thing. They do have some comparable qualities, but are definitely different and each have their own unique purposes separate from each other.
A tagline is a permanent part of a brand that is set in stone. A slogan changes occasionally, and usually represents the current state of a brand and its values. Another thing to point out is that most brands have only one tagline, but they have multiple slogans. A tagline is often integrated into a brand’s elements, and it gives a general vibe or character for products and services. It is specifically about the brand itself.
Slogans are meant to be used for a certain period of time, and then replaced by a more relevant phrase in the future. They’re intended to serve the purpose of promoting a new product, and they’re used extensively in advertisements.
Understanding these differences helps you separate what makes each element important. With that in mind, let’s look at some key ways to successfully build slogans and taglines, starting with slogans.
Helpful hints for creating slogans
Creating a powerful slogan could have a massive impact on a certain advertising campaign or product. Though they’re not always used long term, they still require immense focus and creativity. Here are some tips to make sure you get it right.
1. Creativity stands out
In order to truly get creative and stand out, you’ll need to dive into some extensive research into competitor slogans. It’s important that your slogan not only shines on its own, but especially in comparison to your brand peers.
Keep in mind that, since slogans typically come in multiples, you’ll want to be sure to differentiate from previous and current ones. Also, don’t make it too similar to a competing brand’s slogan, or it will be ineffective to customers.
2. Focus on the right groups
A crucial part of constructing slogans is to remember in what way it will be received by your target market. Any phrase you come up with should go out of its way to please them specifically.
How can you structure your slogan to hit the right demographic? First, examine the ways you could exemplify the spirit of your brand in a short phrase.
For example, a fitness brand could include words that inspire or illuminate the idea of activity into their slogan. Remember to get creative with this when possible. Your slogans are not restricted to the type of products you sell. A mundane and ‘unimportant’ product can be seen in a different light with the right slogan.
3. Short and simple is perfect
Above all else, don’t forget that length is a huge factor in this process, and it’s flat out unacceptable to have a slogan that runs too long. The whole idea is to create something short and simple that sticks in a customer’s head. It should be easy to memorize as well. This is the best way to get your point across anyway for this type of saying.
A brief, simplistic slogan should create something memorable for customers, and the rest of the details can come from other marketing areas.
Lastly, don’t forget that short and simple aren’t the same thing. A complex slogan, though short, might go over a customer’s head. Build a creative yet easy-to-understand phrase.
4. Make changes when needed
As we discussed already, the slogan isn’t meant to be permanent necessarily. There are way too many evolving technologies, social issues, language usage and other factors that prevent a slogan from being successful over longer periods of time.
So what can we do to stay relevant, besides setting a time to update our slogans regularly? The key lies in our research, particularly in how well the motto is performing and being perceived by customers. Remember that just because a slogan works now doesn’t mean it will work later. Be prepared to re-evaluate when necessary.
5. Adapt your slogan to brand values
This idea goes overlooked way too often and leads to unsuccessful slogans: Make sure that any slogan you create aligns, in some way, with your brand ideals and values. The phrase you choose shouldn’t ever counteract the main purpose of your brand, its products or its services.
For example, let’s say your brand wants to retain its traditional values while pushing forward in modern technology. In this case, you could implement a slogan that uses traditional language that hints at being modern simultaneously.
Now that you have some tips for building brand slogans, let’s go into how to create effective taglines.
Tips for coming up with taglines
Similar to brand slogans, the most effective taglines are short and simple. So first things first: Create a tagline that is clear, simple and short, saying enough to get the point across without extra fluff and clutter.
Also keep in mind longevity. The tagline isn’t meant to change. Avoid trendy sayings that will lose their meaning in the future. This should be pretty intuitive, but some research will help the process along.
Now, to make sure your tagline works for your brand, here are some different types to choose from. These give you a basic path to follow in order to set up an effective tagline.
- Inspirational. If you want an inspirational tagline, you’ll want it to promote something informative, spiritual and, of course, inspiring. Using uplifting words can make a tagline inspirational. These types of taglines suggest that a brand’s products or services will enlighten the customer’s life.
- Opposing or outstanding. These taglines are meant to show that a brand is bigger and better than brands from the same industry and market. Disney’s tagline, for example, “The happiest place on Earth” has a touch of comparative language – if it’s the happiest place, other places cannot be.
Let’s now take a look at some of the common (and sometimes overlooked) benefits that come with creating powerful taglines and slogans.
Key benefits of both
Here is a breakdown of some of the most important benefits of an effective slogan or tagline. Remember that these will vary, but the general idea can be applied across a wide range of brand types.
Slogan benefits
Slogans can spotlight the unique values of a brand, while guiding and promoting the release of a new product or service. This simultaneous feature gives brands a chance to feed two birds with one scone, moving forward with something new while showing that the brand behind the product or service is worthy of a customer’s purchase.
A slogan gives brands a chance to show off their brand persona in creative ways, as well. Though a slogan doesn’t have to directly address a product or service a brand offers, it can influence the impact a product might have based on the type of personality a brand has. Remember that you want customers to feel they’re connecting with you, because it will help them choose your product over others.
Lastly, slogans are an effective way to define your brand positioning, which in turn helps your target audience understand the ideals and potential benefits your brand offers. It also boosts brand loyalty, which has endless benefits.
Tagline benefits
Taglines help a brand stand out among competitors, emphasizing how they’re unique. They also help customers recognize their brand through a brief phrase that grows in meaning over time. This feeds into the growth of their brand recognition, which further boosts them past the competition.
One of the biggest benefits the tagline offers is it makes certain brand features and benefits clear. Customers who see a tagline usually get some type of idea about the brand behind the tagline, and thus can expect certain things from products and services that brand puts out. This usually gives off a sense of level of quality, though other values might be attached to it as well.
Now that you’re aware of the benefits these elements bring, let’s look at some of the most effective taglines and slogans throughout history.
Examples to consider
I’ve put together three example slogans and three example taglines that I think illustrate how effective and important these elements can be for a brand. Use them as a reference point for your own creations.
3 awesome brand slogans
1. Disney’s “I’m Going to Disneyland”
What it means: Disneyland is a physical place, and the saying “I’m going to Disneyland” was to be taken literally initially. However, it morphed into much more, as phrases often do. Eventually, the phrase meant that you’re going to celebrate.
Why it works/worked: This slogan promotes that idea that Disney is the place of joy and happiness, and it is the goal where everyone should want to end up. It’s also quite simple, a mere indication that one is going somewhere.
Key takeaway: A slogan should be universal, and appeal to almost everyone who hears it. I’ve never been to Disneyland, for example, but I still connect with this phrase, as do others who have never experienced it.
2. Nike’s “Just Do It”
What it means: “Just do it” is meant to inspire, and means that you should overcome any excuses burdening you (particularly when it comes to athletics).
Why it works/worked: It’s simple, easy to remember and inspiring. It can work on so many levels, and is a great motivator to push oneself further.
Key takeaway: The Nike brand sells an idea as well as clothing products. Customers attach to the idea the slogan presents, making it easier for them to buy Nike products when they’re considering their own athletic future.
3. Verizon’s “Can You Hear Me Now? Good.”
What it means: The slogan comes from recurring commercials from Verizon that had a man ask his anonymous phone call partner, “Can you hear me now? Good”. He walked all over into odd places to ensure they still heard him.
Why it works/worked: The phrase literally showed that Verizon’s service was everywhere, and phone calls wouldn’t be inhibited by lost calls and muffled voice.
Key takeaway: It can be off-putting to demonstrate your actual products or services in an advertisement, but this slogan made a fake demonstration that was subtle and informing, as well as memorable.
3 effective taglines
1. Apple’s “Think Different”
What it means: This tagline often is interpreted in different ways, and that was intended. It is like a play on words, in that it can mean to think of Apple as different, or that it can mean that you should think differently.
Why it works/worked: It not only shows Apple as creative and unique, but it also separates themselves from their competitors.
It’s also interesting to point out that this fits into the ‘opposing’ type of tagline, which we discussed earlier, since it creates a distinction of outdoing its opponents (different is meant to be a positive here, of course).
Key takeaway: You don’t need a long-winded sentence or big words to create a powerful, creative tagline. Consider how to address many different things and impact a lot of emotions with just a few words.
2. Mastercard’s “There Are Some Things Money Can’t Buy. For Everything Else, There’s Mastercard.”
What it means: It is a bit of wisdom that says money can’t buy it all, but it can help fill in the blanks. For example, it can’t buy a moment between you and your favorite opera singer at the show, but it can buy the tickets to that show.
Why it works/worked: This tagline is a catalyst for advertising campaigns, particularly ones that show huge life events happening. Even though the words are basically saying that MasterCard cannot buy you important things, the tagline somehow links them in the customer’s mind anyway.
Key takeaway: Your tagline doesn’t have to be weird or abstract to be effective. This is about as straightforward as it gets, and it has stood the test of time.
3. Samsung’s “the Next Big Thing”
What it means: This tagline means that the Samsung brand is always coming up with and releasing the next thing that will advance technology further.
Why it works/worked: It’s subtle and short without being confusing. It also plays into the industry that Samsung operates in.
Key takeaway: A memorable tagline can go a long way. Think about how impactful a few simple words are, and put them together in the right way.
Final thoughts
Whatever you want to relay to customers, do it in a way that promotes your brand ideals and values. There is a powerful relationship between the two.
When you’ve created your tagline and a few slogans, structure different marketing campaigns around them to help move your brand forward.

January 12, 2023|
A brand story is a valuable marketing tool that drives sales by connecting with customers on a deeper level.
Humans are hardwired to engage with and remember stories, and telling the story of your brand is a unique opportunity. A good brand story creates positive associations and makes customers feel good about buying your products or services.
Conversely, a lackluster brand story (or no story at all) makes it hard for customers to get to know your brand. As a result, every sale is an uphill struggle — especially if your competitors have crafted a story that resonates.
So how do you tell a brand story that truly inspires customers? The good news is there’s probably already a compelling story behind your brand. You just need to find it and leverage it strategically.
What’s a brand story?
A brand story is an engaging, strategic narrative about a brand. Its purpose is to motivate customers with a positive and compelling backstory. A brand story typically touches on a company’s origins and values, and makes customers feel good about their purchase.
Why you should tell the story of your brand
A brand story is more than a nice-to-have. It’s an essential part of a successful marketing strategy. 55% of people say they’re more likely to buy a product if they love the story behind the brand.
Storytelling is an essential part of brand recognition because it taps into the most effective memory mechanisms in the human brain. Research shows that people can recall only 5-10% of statistical information. But when they hear a story, they remember 65-70% of it.
Let’s look at the power of a good brand story in action. Which of these alcohol-free wine labels would you be more excited to try?
Wine Label A
When the founder of Wine Label A stopped drinking for health reasons, he missed the culinary experience of pairing great wines with great food. He found there were many fantastic alcohol-free beers on the market, but alcohol-free wines always seemed to miss the mark. So he partnered with top vineyards to create a range of wines that capture all the nuances and complexity of grapes from different regions — without the alcohol.
Wine Label B
Wine Label B was founded in 2014 and has been expanding their range of alcohol-free wines ever since.
Wine Label A’s story builds credibility. Customers can identify with the company’s founder, and knowing what motivates him fosters a sense of trust in the quality of his company’s product.
Wine Label B’s story is generic and impersonal, so there’s nothing for customers to connect with. Most people would probably be more excited to try Label A’s wine, simply because the story behind it inspires trust, confidence, and curiosity.
A good brand story shows customers that your brand is more than just a company trying to make a sale. It makes them want to do business with you, not only because they need the service or product you offer, but because they trust your brand and like the story behind it.
How to tell an amazing brand story
A brand story is a marketing tool, not a comprehensive account of your company’s history. It pays to be strategic about the story you tell and how you tell it.
That doesn’t mean your story should be fabricated — a disingenuous story is definitely not a good way to get customers to trust you. But you can and should think strategically about which parts of your brand’s history you want to emphasize.
Here are a few key things to consider as you craft an impactful brand story.
1. Remember your purpose
A well-defined brand purpose is a great framework for a compelling brand story.
A brand purpose is a formal understanding of what needs a company addresses from the customer’s perspective. For example, a car company’s brand purpose isn’t to sell cars. But it might be to give people a safe, easy way to get from point A to point B (à la Volvo). Or to create a pleasurable driving experience (think BMW).
Your brand story is the perfect way to show customers why you do what you do in a way that resonates with them.
2. Leverage classic elements of storytelling
Does your story involve a conflict? A quest? Maybe even a villain? These classic storytelling conventions will help you craft a story that’s both engaging and memorable.
You’ll also need to decide who the hero of your story is. Some great options include:
Your company’s founders – A classic choice, and a great way to highlight the passion and expertise behind your products. But tread lightly — a brand story should be about the brand, not a chance for its founders to self-promote.
Your company as a whole – Are you a scrappy start-up taking on the establishment? A local institution with deep roots in the community? Your brand story is a great opportunity to do a bit of brand positioning by showcasing the unique qualities that make your company stand out.
The customer – One of the best ways to connect with customers is to make them (or someone like them) the hero of your brand’s story. This approach has many advocates in the marketing community and is at the center of Donald Miller’s story brand framework. In this approach, the customer overcomes an obstacle, and the brand is a guide or resource that helps them along the way.
3. Keep it short
Your brand story isn’t a novel. Customers want a quick overview of what your brand is about in a tidy, concise package. Structure your story in a way that is informative, inspiring, and creative — but not overly complex. If customers can’t learn your brand story in a few minutes, they probably won’t bother.
4. Keep your audience in mind
The most important thing to consider when writing your brand story is what you want customers to take away from it. After all, the sole purpose of a brand story is to connect with them and build brand loyalty.
Think of how your story might resonate with the people who buy (or might buy) your services and products. Put yourself in their shoes to pick out details and narratives that will make people want to be a part of your story.
5. Incorporate your products and services
The ultimate goal of your brand story is to make customers feel good about buying your products or services — so be sure to include them in your narrative.
If your offerings have evolved over the years, you might have to get a little creative. Maybe your commitment to quality has stayed the same, even as your product line has changed. Maybe your company has always been focused on incorporating new technology to offer the most cutting-edge, modern services.
Whatever your brand’s history, there’s a great narrative somewhere waiting to be crafted. You just have to think strategically to find it.
Examples of effective brand stories
Need a bit of inspiration? You probably already know the story of a successful brand or two — even if you don’t think about it in those terms. The following examples are a great way to see how a brand story can influence and inspire customers.
Apple
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, working with what little means they had, were able to build a computer they hoped would be the next big thing in computing. Unfortunately, resources were tight.
To overcome their limited resources, they stored many of their equipment tools in a garage, then sold some of their important belongings to finish their projects.
Apple had an uphill battle entering an industry with a powerful competitor, Microsoft. However, through perseverance, hard work, and creativity, they thrived, becoming the tech-leading brand they are today.
Takeaways:
- Highlight obstacles you overcame. Early adversity makes the Apple story dynamic and engaging.
- Be relatable. People might think of Apple as a faceless tech giant, but the company’s humble origin story paints the brand in a more approachable light.
Mailchimp
Mailchimp began as a way for its founders to deliver powerful web design to large enterprises. Eventually, they realized that their biggest skills and passions involved working with small businesses.
These beginnings made it easier for Mailchimp to be successful, pushing the creativity of their teams in order to make their products work for everyone who uses them.
Now, Mailchimp is still working to deliver effective services to small businesses, but they do so with more than just email tools.
Takeaways:
- Put your customer in the story. Small businesses reading the Mailchimp story know right off the bat: “This product is for me.”
- Connect new products to established values. Mailchimp tells a story of growth and change without seeming inconsistent or unstable.
Warby Parker
The problem, as the founders of Warby Parker saw it, was that eyewear was so overpriced it was an inconvenience to simply exist if you had eyesight issues and needed glasses. Fueling this problem was a large industry leader that no one was willing to go up against.
That’s where Warby Parker entered, giving their competition a run for their money while making glasses much more affordable.
To further dedicate themselves to this cause, they now partner with other groups that help locate eyewear for the needy across the globe.
Takeaways:
- Everyone loves an underdog. Taking on the big guys is a big part of what makes Warby Parker’s story so compelling.
- Show the customer what’s in it for them. Customers don’t flock to Warby Parker just to stick it to eyewear industry giants. The story is a vehicle for a more important message: You can trust us not to overcharge you.
Weave your brand story into the customer experience
A brand story is much more than a few lines of copy on your “About Us” page. It’s an integral part of your brand identity. To leverage it successfully, customers need to encounter content that complements your story throughout the buyer journey.
You can invest lots of time, energy, and money creating content that tells your brand’s story, but it won’t have much impact if you don’t get it in front of the right people at the right time. In order to communicate and build a brand effectively, you’ll need to have a good brand management strategy in place.
Fortunately, the right tools make that possible. Canto is an innovative digital asset management platform that provides a single source of truth for your brand and all the content behind it. By enabling you to organize, manage, and distribute your brand assets, Canto makes it easy to manage your brand and tell its story across every touchpoint.

November 4, 2020|
Imagine what would happen if you asked a hundred people to draw you a picture of a house. No two drawings would be alike, even if two participants lived together.
Now imagine they’re not drawing houses, but your brand’s logo. Suddenly the stakes are much higher, and the differences become a problem. A brand style guide puts everyone on the same page, so your brand looks and sounds the same across the board.
What Is a Brand Style Guide?
A brand style guide is a document that outlines ideal brand guidelines. It ensures acceptable use of things like themes, logos, tone and more. It also informs company employees how to conform to organizational standards when working on important projects.
Think of a brand style guide as a manual that dictates the feel of your brand. Let’s say a company wishes to advertise a new product they’ve created. They decide to hire a creative marketing company to produce the ad for them.
Now, in order to ensure that this external group knows what type of style and tone the advertisement they should use, the company sends them their style guide. This gives them a simple reference point without the back and forth that otherwise might occur.
The Purpose of a Brand Style Guide
A brand style guide helps brands maintain brand consistency throughout all different types of campaigns, projects and advertisements that communicate with their target audience.
It ensures both internal and external contributors know the expected brand standards and how to implement them.
It also lets a wide range of creators make projects and campaigns that maintain the correct types of design, writing and other project elements.
Now that you understand what a brand style guide is for, let’s take a look at how to create your own.
Tips for Creating a Brand Style Guide
First, let me make it clear that no two style guides should be exactly alike. I mean this both in terms of the content and the layout. You don’t need to be unique in every aspect, but there should be at least some semblance of distinctiveness in your guide. Here are some helpful tips to get you started.
Visual Elements
“Design is the silent ambassador of your brand.” – Paul Rand
One key element of nearly all style guides is the inclusion of the brand’s brand’s logo (or logos). Guidelines need to cover how the logo should be in all respects, what color(s) it should be and where it needs to be placed.
The issue that usually arises with projects is logo placement varying, as well as other variables that might be different. Ensure that your guide informs everyone of what to do, so they’re prepared each time.
The next visual element to focus on is font, particularly what type of font should be used for specific projects. Now, keep in mind that different font levels get quite complex and can’t be explained briefly. Instead, you’ll need to use details beyond a font name or size.
Include changeable differences like bold words, italics and underlined letters. Finally, make sure to clarify which type of font is used when switching from a title to a header, or from a header to the content text.
Brand Voice and Messaging
Brand voice is often confused to be something abstract that cannot be directly put down into a guide for reference. This is just not the case, and as you’ll see, you can give exact descriptions of the correct brand voice you wish to portray at all times.
One of the best ways to do this effectively is to create a list of words that describe your brand voice . For example, your voice might be ‘upbeat’, ‘modern’ and ‘dynamic’. Conversely, words like ‘negative’ and ‘rigid’ could be used to show styles you discourage.
Lastly, your brand style guide can outline spelling and grammar rules your brand follows. It’s not always known that spelling differs geographically, so having a clear guide sets everyone straight.
A Story to Set the Tone Going Forward
When many people think of a brand style guide, they think of the many ways it defines a brand through visual elements and rules. Though it does these things, another thing it does is show your overall brand tone, values and ideals.
By including a story about your brand, you give insight into what your brand cares about and the type of brand it is. Depending on what type of brand you are, this story can range from lighthearted to serious to somewhere in between.
Improving Your Current Brand Style Guide
If your brand already has a style guide, do a quick audit to see what – if anything – could be improved. If you find the guide to be outdated, consider keeping a regularly scheduled check to upkeep the overall quality.
The first thing you’ll want to do is determine how well your current guide portrays the values, voice and themes of the brand. This is especially vital, as it gets to the heart of your brand identity.
Next, consider the ways your guide is distributed. Are there things you can do to improve upon this process? It makes a bigger difference than you might think. For example, in the past, brands used to send out a PDF document file to employees and external contributors.
Now there are better ways to deliver the guide. One such is to host it in a central location and send out a link. That way, you can update the document regularly, and people always have access to the most current version.
5 Examples to Learn From
One of the best ways to create your own guide is to first get a glimpse at successful brand’s attempts. Here are five unique brand style guides to consider.
1. Netflix
Netflix has set the standard for digital streaming. Their guide focuses on the all-important visual assets that make up their brand identity. Part of what makes Netflix so powerful, after all, is how easy it is for almost anyone to recognize their logo.
What makes Netflix’s style guide stand out: Netflix’s brand style guide not only describes how their visuals speak to customers, it also gives detailed information about how, when and where to use the logo. The guide also makes it easy to obtain files which contain their logos.
Check out the Netflix document here.
2. Microsoft
Microsoft continues to define the way users interact with a personal computer. Their brand style guide explains how to replicate the Microsoft style of writing across different types of content.
What makes Microsoft’s style guide stand out: The complexity of the guide is the first thing users notice. It’s hard to believe that any rock goes unturned with this guide, letting users navigate endless topics concerning the correct brand standards Microsoft has set for themselves.
See the Microsoft guide here.
3. Zoom
Zoom has taken the world of online communication by storm, surpassing more generic platforms like Skype. Their brand style guide gives all the necessary details required to represent the Zoom brand in simplistic, easy-to-navigate fashion.
What makes Zoom’s style guide stand out: The Zoom style guide is filled with plenty of white space. Content like logos and fonts stand out, helping users get it right the first time. Visually, this guide stands out the most among other brand’s guides.

4. Apple
Apple manages to be on the cutting edge of technology, forcing the industry to adhere to their own standards when it comes to new tools. Their style guide gives key insight into the best ways to advertise Apple products, including the type of things that detract from the overall Apple message.
What makes Apple’s style guide stand out: The detail of Apple’s style guide is intense. I feel confident that anyone following the document will uphold Apple’s core values and ideals throughout each new type of project and advertisement.
Check out the guide here.
5. Google
Google has set itself apart as the search engine delivering the best results and user experience. Their style guide focuses more on formatting than other brands do, which makes sense considering the way the website operates.
What makes Google’s style guide stand out: Though Google’s brand style guide does include all the different types of punctuation and spelling it requires, it goes much further than that. They have loads of information within about things like headers, formatting and even linking.
Check it out here.
Adapting for the Future
A brand style guide shouldn’t be locked in forever, but instead needs to evolve alongside your brand. As you progress, update everything within your style guide to share the new standards being set. Note that these updates will typically require some type of new advisory and education for employees, so have a concrete schedule in place. However, don’t update the guide too often, either.
Furthermore, note that the only way your style guide can be effective throughout changes is if employees are aware of them. Luckily, digital systems are available to ensure everyone stays on brand and notices new changes.
Final Thoughts
A brand style guide is like a key to a castle. Once users are given the key, they should be able to easily explore it and never again be stuck on the outside looking in.
The power of a brand style guide, especially one that is periodically updated when needed, cannot be understated. Don’t forget the immense responsibility that comes with creating this document.

93,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-transparency/,"Nowhere to hide: Stepping into the spotlight with brand transparency
July 29, 2020|
Yesterday’s Sherlock Holmes, Columbos or Nancy Drews are today’s average person with internet access.
Instead of digging for clues out in the field and using years of intuition to reach conclusions, the answers are delivered immediately and clearly right to our screens.
Many brands have taken a hit due to this ever-present concept, falling victim to uncoverings of information they thought wouldn’t be found.
If they had understood this one, simple thing, they would’ve been fine: brand transparency.
Even though transparency is the answer, many brands don’t yet have the right formula to reach that answer.
What is brand transparency?
Brand transparency is how a brand shows itself to be genuine and open, especially regarding public interactions. It is one of the most powerful ways to gain the trust and loyalty of a target market. Brand transparency mostly refers to a brand’s active attempts at honesty.
Keep in mind that brand transparency isn’t always the opposite of brand dishonesty. It’s much more complex than that.
Here are some ways to be transparent:
- Communicate with customers
- Be available
- Be honest
- Don’t hide from mistakes
- Avoid half-truths and sneaky practices
As you can see, the factors that make up a transparent brand are pretty wide-ranging. They involve creating clarity concerning certain values and ideals. They also include pulling back the curtain on products and services, when possible.
There are a lot of things you can be transparent about, as well:
- Pricing
- Products/materials/ingredients
- Past mistakes
- Values/ideals
Brand transparency will mean different things to different brands, but the main principles should remain consistent – be open and available to target audiences.
In this article, I’ll shape your approach to transparency with proven strategies designed to go above and beyond. Let’s get started.
Why transparency is needed, especially today
Let me start off by saying this: In today’s climate, all brands are transparent, whether they want to be or not.
However, some brands are still trying to hide or cover things up, while others are working towards showing themselves even more.
So when I use ‘transparency’ throughout this article, it means an attempt to be honest or genuine.
You’re probably wondering if the only reason to be honest is because it’s too hard to cover negative press up these days. The answer is no, being an honest brand is:
1. The smart and right thing to do anyway
2. Pretty much forced with the amount of information available in modern times
3. An expectation of your target market, and this expectation seems to grow stronger each year
It starts to become clear, as you examine the current landscape for major brands, that it’s necessary to be open and forthright. Here’s an example to demonstrate further.
An example case for transparency
Imagine there are three major fast food brands serving the global market in the 1980s.
Things are going well for them all, until the 90s, where customer trends change. In the 90s, customers began to want detailed information about the nutrition data for their fast food.
Two of the three brands capitulate, deciding that it was a good idea to give the customers what they wanted. As a result, customers began to choose these two brands and stopped buying from the third brand.
Nothing had changed, yet the third brand somehow looked bad, simply for not recognizing the importance of transparency.
Now, this isn’t to say that if your competition does something, you must follow suit. However, when it comes to sincerity, you do have to keep up with (and hopefully surpass) the competition.
Before we go over the benefits (and there are plenty), let’s look at the negative effects of dishonesty (there are plenty more).
Failing to be transparent – the resulting consequences
“Take the long way. Do the hard work, consistently and with generosity and transparency. And then you won’t waste time doing it over.” – Seth Godin
Just as there is a problem with lying, there is similarly a problem with being too tight-lipped. You don’t have to be dishonest to be perceived as perceptive. All it takes, in fact, is to not be open enough with audiences.
With that in mind, here are some potential negative effects you can’t ignore:
Loss of control
Being truthful and putting our values and experiences out there for all to see allows us to control and dictate the narrative. Not doing so often results in a loss of control.
When we don’t present ourselves with sincerity and reveal important information, chances are customers will seek alternative sources for it. This could be concerning our products, services or even some event.
Opening up gives us a chance to set the record straight or give helpful facts and details. Failing to do so leads customers to speculate or find potentially faulty information.
Ultimately, it doesn’t matter what the real facts are if our customers never get to hear them.
Loss of customers
As i pointed out in the fast food example above, a lack of openness typically leads to a lack of customers.
It stands to reason that, if a majority of direct competitors are open and honest, your target market will expect the same. If they don’t receive it, they’ll leave.
This can be the result of many different factors, but the common denominator is a lack of clarity. If the competition is available on social media, you should be too. If they respond to negative questions or comments, you do the same. The customers will notice.
The last thing you want is for a valued customer to feel shut out. Keep this in mind as you learn more about the important strategies to stay open and honest at all times.
Getting exposed is worse than self-uncovering
If it’s not obvious to everyone by now, it is pretty easy to find just about anything with a computer and internet connection.
When you take into consideration the massive mounds of data compiled and stored, and how quickly it can be searched through, the average person might as well be considered a supersleuth.
Attempting to hide details from the public, in today’s landscape, is almost comical.
Whatever it is you’re uncertain about uncovering, chances are it will happen anyway and with potential consequences.
As long as you stick to ideals and values, the results will be acceptable. Even if some customers don’t agree, others will. Might as well be open to avoid alienating the customers who would have stuck around regardless.
It’s tough to examine the negatives, but it’s a necessary evil, especially when it comes to this topic. Luckily, you’re now armed with the knowledge of pitfalls to avoid. Even better, we’re going to jump into the benefits.
Brand transparency benefits
Fortunately, the rewards of honesty and authenticity are well worth the efforts you’ll put into creating them. Here are some that cannot be ignored.
Increased customer loyalty
Approximately 65% of customers will stay loyal to a brand they believe to be genuine. This is a staggering number, especially considering there will be other reasons customers will stick with you, making the percentage much higher.
Add this to the fact that 75% of these same customers will spend more money for products and services from a transparent brand, and the benefits become undeniable.
Customer loyalty is something brands strive to obtain, so by the same token, their efforts should include a sound strategy to build and maintain honesty and authenticity.
When customers feel they dealt with a sincere, authentic brand, they want to experience that again. Each new experience with the honest brand strengthens the bond, building customer loyalty.
Internal inspiration and energization
Committing to bettering your truthfulness has deeper implications than making your customers happy.
A sincere brand is something that creates enthusiastic employees as well. Also consider how hiring processes are positively affected. It stands to reason that your honesty will draw in superior candidates, giving you the pick of the litter.
This is the kind of inspiration that boosts creativity and positivity among internals, which in turn spreads to potential customers.
Builds brand advocacy
A brand advocate has exponential value, especially in today’s well-connected world of digital options. On top of this, an advocate champions your causes for free, and their opinion is well-respected because of it.
It doesn’t take long to notice the difference strong advocacy makes. It’s estimated that 40% of purchases are inspired by some type of recommendation.
Authenticity ignites customers to become advocates, sending sparks of sales, increased revenues and the chance to lure more customers.
Lastly, advocates ensure that your honesty spreads through word-of-mouth, basically acting as an advertisement for your authenticity.
The benefits of keeping things open and honest are immense, so you’ll want to do everything possible to earn them. Without a clear strategy, chances are there will be many errors along the way.
Fortunately, I’ve come up with dynamic methods you’ll be able to immediately add to your repertoire.
A system of strategies to help you succeed
We can’t escape from the fundamentals, and I certainly won’t steer clear of them here. However, it’s clear that, especially in today’s competitive landscape, our branding strategies need a mixture of basic, creative and contrarian aspects in order to allow us to stand out among the competition.
That’s what I’m going to provide here, the unorthodox strategies needed to get a leg up on other brands, and possibly get you thinking differently about transparency.
Do not pretend, even slightly, that you are perfect
“Perfection does not exist — you can always do better and you can always grow.” – Les Brown
Your brand isn’t perfect. The good thing is, no brand is. Even better is the fact that everyone already knows this. There are a lot of negative aspects that come with attempting to be perfect or feigning perfection.
We’re going to avoid these negatives by doing something a lot of brands fail to even consider most of the time: letting down our guard.
Revealing vulnerabilities to our target audience is an offbeat way to handle branding throughout all different types of problems, conversations and tasks.
Embracing your flaws opens up lines of communication with customers, helping them let their guard down with us in return. There’s a certain humanity behind the idea of imperfections.
Not only that, but it also creates more future possibilities to connect with target markets, since they’ll naturally be more trustworthy.
Remember that I’m not suggesting you spend hours each day confessing about each error made or degrading your brand. However, you absolutely should take a few jabs at yourself every once in a while.
Brand persona – striking the right behavioral balance
In the movie ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’, the notorious robot ‘HAL’ becomes the antagonist of the film when it’s determined it has bad intentions.
One key moment of the film comes when the pilots of the spaceship where HAL is a passenger realize they shouldn’t trust the machine. They speak somewhere that HAL cannot hear them, only to be found out through lip-reading.
As demonstrated by the ‘2001’ pilots, (and most likely, almost everyone who ever watched the film) there’s just something about nonhumans that is impossible for us to trust. That’s not to say we always trust other human beings, but certainly we try to, and specific characteristics bolster that trust.
A brand is not a human. However, the right brand persona can build trust with a target market. There’s technically no wrong way to build a persona, though it should relate to your audience as best as possible.
Imagine, for a moment, that your customers were asked some questions about your brand. If they were asked about your sense of humor, what would their answer be? How serious are you? Laid back? Friendly? Believe it or not, you’d likely get some pretty detailed answers.
Consider what types of answers your brand would get, then build a persona the way you would want the customers to answer.
In order to win their trust, you have to be much more than a robot on a spaceship.
Enhance your feedback
First and most importantly, it’s impossible to accept any suggestions or make new changes without a legitimate structure for receiving extensive feedback to begin with.
This has to be our starting point in order to tackle feedback. There should be numerous opportunities for our target audience to deliver their feedback to us. This will vary for different brands, so think of the most convenient methods you can offer personally.
Next, show that you’re open to getting feedback. Customers will be reluctant to share negative thoughts, stories or experiences about your brand if they see a public denouncement of feedback, no matter how justified you felt it was.
That’s not to say you can’t respond to negative feedback, but do so in a way that is professional and shows you’ve acknowledged all of the problems the customer had.
Finally, the only way a feedback system will show your brand to be transparent is if it’s clear you absorb the suggestions when receiving them. It’s pretty obvious to a reviewer when their feedback was truly valued and absorbed or not.
Even if they’re certain nothing will change as a result, they want to know there was thoughtful consideration on the other end. An automated cookie-cutter response will not accomplish this. Go above and beyond what other brands will do to show you value feedback, and audiences will respond favorably.
Increase your overall communication
We hear all the time about how people say they want transparent, genuine brands, but what does that mean? Are they referring to honesty? Clarity of products and services?
All too often, what gets lost in this vague phrasing is the extensive communication required to be an authentic, sincere brand.
Though it is expected of brands to communicate with customers, this is also a vague expectation. In order to truly be genuine in your correspondence, consider the following principles: where at, how often and how well.
Where at?
First, let’s explore the ‘where at’ part of the communication equation. Do customers feel they’re able to reach your brand in different locations and on different mediums? If they compared you to competitors, would you be more accessible?
Re-evaluate the accessibility and connectedness of your brand and try to structure it in a way that widens communication.
How often?
Next, the ‘how often’ aspect is concerned with the volume, both the in-conversation volume and the amount of conversations. This doesn’t have to be a direct one-on-one chat, either. There are many different ways to increase this volume.
Consider the reactions users had to transparency on social media (chart courtesy sproutsocial):
Emails, newsletters and random updates on social media count towards this volume, too. Don’t overdo it, but make sure you’re giving audiences enough of what they want when it comes to communication.
How well?
Last but not least, the ‘how well’ portion is a measurement of the quality of communication your brand has with customers.
Similar to the above, this also doesn’t need to be a one-on-one conversation in order to count. It suggests that there are a multitude of ways a brand can have thoughtful communication with customers that extends further than basic greetings and pre-determined messages.
When done correctly, even non-human contact can be satisfying to customers.
Final point to consider: Communicating well involves understanding of the dynamics involved from medium to medium. A conversation between brand and customer on a company website will almost certainly require a different tone than a conversation on social media.
These strategies will provide you more than enough resources to get started. Now that you have them, seeing some examples of other companies who got transparency right is key.
Examples of brands who do it right
The following brands understand exactly what’s needed to propel their authenticity and honesty. Use them as a way to carve your own path.
Buffer
Buffer is first up on the list as their brand has been making waves in a lot of different circles as going above and beyond the typical requirements for transparency.
A simple visit to their website will confirm this fact, as the ‘About’ section lists transparency first under their values.
Where they really shine, however, is their business model of keeping everything open source and all their projects available for everyone to see. Most notably, especially to the general public, is that all salaries are publicly available. They’ve taken transparency to another level.
McDonald’s
McDonald’s gets brought up a lot when speaking about transparency. With their immense success came scrutinization that often went unchecked.
To improve upon this and show themselves as an honest brand, McDonald’s has launched many different initiatives to put everything out in the open.
The most notable campaign offered a chance for people to ask any questions they had about the product the restaurant was selling. Many flocked to the website to give it a shot, receiving all sorts of legitimate answers to unique questions.
Many feel this campaign was a gold standard for building transparency, at least in the fast food industry.
PayPal
PayPal’s overwhelming popularity has made them a target for all types of scamming attempts. Fortunately, PayPal used their different communicative avenues to let audiences know what they would do to combat this and exactly the effect it would have.
On top of this, the online payments company offers support and wide-reaching communication beyond their website. They have active social media accounts that serve as another form of help and security for customers.
Ultimately, PayPal is aware that when so many transactions are completed between different parties, the potential for fraud, scams and disagreements increases. However, due to their willingness to be open and honest, they’ve been able to keep this under control and give customers the service they need to be satisfied.
Your trek to truth
You won’t get far without complex, unique strategies and structured implementation of brand transparency. However, the challenge doesn’t end there. This process should become a lifestyle of your brand.
Finally, remember that this is not always going to be easy. Commit to the uncomfortable – it could make all the difference.

August 17, 2020|
“Brand is the sum total of how someone perceives a particular organization. Branding is about shaping that perception.” – Ashley Friedlein
When you make a batch of cookies, the outcome (how well they taste) is influenced by the steps you take, such as the ingredients used, the tools utilized and the directions followed.
Poor ingredients and weak recipes result in treats that don’t taste good. High quality ingredients and an award-winning recipe create delicious cookies.
The structure of how cookies are made is similar to the brand value chain. Like cookies, each part of the brand leads to the important conclusion: what is its overall value (do the cookies taste good)?
In this article, I’ll explain in detail the brand value chain model, so that you can see the different factors that go into a brand’s overall value.
This will help you further your own value, because it becomes clear what types of things need attention in order to succeed. The last thing you want, after all, is a batch of cookies that don’t taste good.
What is a brand value chain?
A brand value chain dictates the process, from start to finish, of how a brand creates value. Using a brand value chain model guides a company through necessary steps needed to improve their value. Though these models seem linear, they often vary.
The beginning reference point for creating a brand value chain model is the Keller and Lehmann study, which moved each value stage along with the help of specific outside factors called ‘multipliers’.
The Keller and Lehmann study shouldn’t be copied word for word, but instead should be a general reference.
I find it most helpful, for anyone creating their own structure, to take the general concepts of Keller and Lehmann’s model and fill in the inputs which best suit you specifically.
The above model will help you visualize how to structure your chain.
Understanding how the model works is easy when you think of it in its most basic, barebones terms: You’re trying to build value. The process begins in the first step (the first value stage), and ultimately leads to the 4th stage (where the value is then measured).
Each step is affected by how well a task is completed, as well as other external factors. This effect is the ‘multiplier’.
As you can see, my stages are: marketing engagement, customer perception/image, market performance, financial value.
Now, I’ll fill in my multipliers so you have the whole picture of the entire process:
The multipliers will act as influences upon the value stage – they suggest how well everything is working, and ultimately how much value will be created at the end of all the stages.
Value stages
The following are each stage of the brand value chain model, followed by their respective multiplier if applicable.
Value stage 1 – marketing engagement
“Make a customer, not a sale.” – Katherine Barchetti
The initial phase, marketing engagement, details the different ways in which brands reach out to potential customers.
This stage covers the investments into marketing programs that power product research, communications and more.
The overall goal during this value stage is to positively influence the potential client, showing them all the ways in which you can meet their current needs.
This process includes advertisements and marketing campaigns, but these are only half the battle. The other half is affected mostly by your ability to communicate and form relationships with customers.
The first value stage requires a detailed understanding of how your brand, as a whole, communicates with customers.
Multiplier – engagement quality
So, we know that the first stage deals with our marketing engagement and customer relations. The multiplier, in this case, is the quality that goes into each aspect of the process.
Here is a breakdown of each factor to consider – remember that yours may vary slightly, but should be relatively similar:
Suitability
Essentially, this is a measurement of how suitable your marketing program is for the customer’s specific needs.
Make sure to learn, evaluate and understand what types of problems a customer has, then present them your services as the solution.
Uniqueness
This one is crucial, because guess what – you’re not going to have the only marketing campaign a customer will see.
There will be plenty more, in fact. How well will yours stand out? Why should the customer choose you?
Give them a good reason, starting with a unique and enticing marketing campaign that uses brand differentiation to help you stand out from other brands.
Consistency
It almost goes without saying that the performance of your marketing campaigns will be directly affected by how consistent they are.
This includes sticking to values at all times, and using the correct branding elements on different projects and advertisements. A good understanding of brand consistency goes a long way.
Coherence
Above all, your marketing campaigns need to be coherent. Consider the ways in which your target market will construe these campaigns.
Remember that part of this marketing engagement should involve customer feedback. This will give you a general idea how well the campaigns are relating to your audience.
Tying everything together, the first value stage is simply our marketing engagement and how well we are doing it. This will affect the next stage, customer perception and brand image.
Value stage 2 – customer perception and brand image
“The customer’s perception is your reality.” – Kate Zabriskie
The customer perception and brand image stage measures how well customers have responded to the marketing program.
In this part of the process, here are the most important factors:
- Awareness
- Loyalty
- Attitude
I’ll break down all three in detail, after I briefly explain brand image.
Brand image is how a customer perceives a brand. Whatever the brand believes itself to be is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is how the customer see it – the brand image.
Let’s dive into the important factors of this value stage.
Awareness
Awareness is how well customers are able to recognize specific traits and qualities of a brand. It is essentially the popularity of a brand.
Part of brand awareness is how a customer feels when seeing a brand element, such as a logo or color scheme.
Loyalty
Brand loyalty is when a customer uses a particular brand’s services repeatedly, choosing to support them and make purchases from them regardless of price or changes in the market.
Loyalty also implies that a customer will recommend the brand to others, and might remain loyal even if the quality of the service diminishes, though there are limits.
Attitude
Attitude is closely related to feelings that a customer has about a brand. It is usually linked to product performance, though efficacy of marketing campaigns is a factor as well.
Attitude is also driven by a willingness to make necessary changes to services based on customer needs.
Multiplier – current market status
The current market status multiplier influences how well customer perception directly affects the market.
This multiplier depends on the following factors, which I’ll explain in detail:
Competition marketing quality
This is, simply put, the level of quality that your direct competitors produce in their own marketing campaigns.
Similarly, this is usually affected by the response your competitors have in reaction to your marketing projects.
Channel support
Channel support is simply a measurement of how well a brand makes use of all attainable channels.
This response is affected by the branding efforts of the different members of marketing teams and partners.
Customer demographics
The customer demographics refers to different characteristics of the customers who are interested in the brand and its products or services.
These characteristics include things such as the quantity of customers involved, what type of customer they are and how profitable they potentially could be.
The customer perception value stage we just reviewed, leads directly to market performance.
Value stage 3 – market performance
“Growth is never by mere chance; it is the result of forces working together.” – J.C. Penney
The market performance phase measures the total effectiveness the brand has on the market, based on different factors, including:
Market share
Market share is the amount of sales within a market that your brand specifically attains.
This is affected by the amount of customer advocacy or brand advocates you’ve built through marketing campaigns and other factors.
Expansion success
If a brand is successful, it will be a lot easier for them to expand into new markets, which will increase their market value overall.
One way they might do this is by creating a new product or service, that is designed to cater to a new demographic. The reason this is possible is they’ve built their awareness, so the product will be new but the brand behind it won’t.
Cost savings
This result is cyclical, in that the more effective a marketing campaign is, the more you can save on future campaigns.
Price premiums
Sometimes, a brand might place a higher price on an item or service because either the item/service is of higher quality than its competitors, or they want customers to believe it’s of higher quality.
In this case, the higher price is based on the fact that the brand is effective, thus customers will pay a higher price for its products.
Profitability
When everything goes right for a brand’s different marketing campaigns, the brand improves. As this happens, profitability increases.
Multiplier – investor tendencies
Financial experts and investors influence this particular multiplier. Investor tendencies help determine whether or not performance is equally represented in shareholder value.
Current market situation
The investor tendencies, first and foremost, are generally dictated by the current situation of the markets. They’ll respond to it in different ways.
Growth potential
Growth potential is the overall revenue a brand is able to bring in, which fuels speculation concerning how large it can become.
Risk profile
The risk profile details all types of risks and the potential effect those will have on overall well-being.
The market performance value stage, as we see from the factors above, sets up the final stage, financial value.
Value stage 4 – financial value
The final stage is the financial value of the brand. This is where all the factors and influences are calculated and measured, which will then dictate true value. The biggest factors include the stock price and the P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio.
Takeaways
Fill in your own brand value chain and work through each stage. There’s a good chance that something within the steps can be improved.

September 2, 2020|
“Why fit in when you were born to stand out?” – Dr. Seuss
Writing a decent brand value proposition requires research and analysis of the current market and direct competition.
Therefore, at least indirectly, it will make you more aware of how competitors behave and how to create separation between them and yourself.
As a result, you’ll be able to better relay to customers how your services will suit their needs better than any of your competitors. This contrast is a huge key to overall success.
Before I explain what a brand value proposition is, I first need to make sure you have a reasonable grasp on the concept of brand value.
What is brand value?
At the most fundamental level, brand value is a data-driven measurement of a company’s financial worth. Figuring out a brand value is done through market analysis. Essentially, it is how much a buyer would be willing to pay for the brand.
When we dig deeper, it’s clear that brand value is also a valuation of worth based on a brand’s relation to its direct competition. This impacts how much more customers will pay for a product or service from a specific company over another.
What is a brand value proposition?
A brand value proposition is a commitment made specifically to a target audience. This commitment includes a concrete reason or reasons why customers should use a company’s service. A brand value proposition gives detailed reasons why a product or service is right for a particular market.
It’s easier to understand when broken down into smaller parts:
- Problems solved
- Services offered
- Benefits offered
I will go further into detail about these later. For now, just note that a brand value proposition proposes the above features to customers.
There are a lot of benefits that come with writing effective brand value propositions. 75% of B2B companies created some type of value proposition, so clearly they are important. Let’s take a look at some of the most helpful benefits.
Benefits of creating an effective brand value proposition
The better your value proposition, the stronger the benefits will be. Here are a few invaluable perks of getting the value proposition done correctly.
Boosts conversions and increases overall leads
If your value proposition is intriguing, it could be a large part of why a sale gets closed. It also may be your best chance at keeping customers engaged and interested, rather than turned off and on to the next site.
Similarly, a value proposition increases overall leads – both in value and abundance. By being upfront about what your brand offers, customers gauge your products and services alongside their needs and potential concerns.
This ushers them through any uncertainty and directs them toward a decision.
Centralizes attention and eliminates waste
A value proposition narrows your attention to the most important issues at hand, giving your teams a better chance at determining the right way to help specific audiences.
It centralizes focus toward customers and how you can help them, then specifies what it will take to be successful and meet your target audience’s needs.
A value proposition is a guiding force, keeping the right things at the forefront of campaigns, projects and activities.
Furthermore, this attention to detail helps eliminate waste. For example, if a project or campaign doesn’t fit within your value proposition model, it will be easier to recognize and dismiss.
A brand value proposition drains out any unnecessary tasks and refines your processes. This is a huge part of being successful, by sticking to the things your audience truly requires.
Spotlights the advantages you offer compared to the competition
It’s just not possible to create a groundbreaking value proposition without putting in some serious research of your competitors.
Part of the proposition writing process involves growing in your understanding of the direct competition. This in turn allows you to figure out ways to boost your brand differentiation.
Oftentimes, during the creation of your value proposition, it’s easy to become more in-tune with what your customers want and how to deliver it to them.
Outlines a clear path forward
Uncertainty and imprecision are enemies of any new project, campaign, service, company or product. Any missteps involving clarity are devastating, resulting in a group of potential customers who feel your services don’t suit them.
A brand value proposition cuts through ambiguity, carving a clear, focused path forward. It not only establishes a substantive need that your prepared solution can meet, but it also pinpoints which potential markets require these solutions.
With a clear path laid out in front of you, it becomes a lot easier to progress through each task without any uncertainty or doubt. This inspires teams and amplifies overall values and goals.
Helps brands relate to customers and understand their needs
A brand value proposition is a key tool to provide you with a foundation for which to connect with your customers and understand their needs.
It increases the level of engagement with customers, helping you gain valuable insight into how they value your services overall.
More importantly, this ensures that you’re connecting with prospects who feel you’re the answer to their problems, making them a likely candidate to make a purchase.
Ultimately, a value proposition cuts to the heart of what your target market truly wants, rather than beating around the bush with flimsy features. It allows you to base your entire solution on helping customers in the way they need most, which builds brand loyalty.
Clarifies marketing tasks and objectives
Marketing is a direct beneficiary of an effective value proposition, since the proposition creates guidelines to follow and focus on.
Armed with the knowledge given to them through this, marketers can better understand which type of customers to pursue and what types of needs they have.
They’re then able to use this specificity to create the most on-point campaigns that directly address the types of features they can offer to audiences.
On top of outlining marketing tasks, it also helps focus and align marketing messages to increase overall influence and effect.
It guides marketers through each potential branding task, giving them a foundation from which to build steady and focused messaging.
As you can see, there are enormous benefits to a value proposition done-right. Therefore, it’s important to create one that adheres to all the important guidelines.
How to write a value proposition that goes above and beyond
In order to write an effective value proposition, you first need to understand what types of things make up a good one.
Provide clear details as to why your brand is right for the audience. This is done in a brief, concise manner that is as descriptive as possible. It also offers a clear promise.
Here are some helpful hints to follow when writing your proposition:
- Keep it simple while delivering a clear picture of what your services will provide. It’s meant to be short, but that doesn’t mean unclear. Include the essentials.
- It’s not a mystery or a poem. Don’t get too tricky and confuse the customer. They should be able to understand it without ‘Googling’.
- You’re not convincing someone to buy a timeshare property or magic beanstalk. Leave the excessive advertising jargon, claims and over-promotion out of it.
Every proposition is different! Don’t feel that you need to follow some specific template or path to create yours.
However, do keep in mind that there are general guidelines to follow. Here is a basic rundown of what your proposition should entail:
- Main header
- Subheader
- Supporting images
The header is the most important part of the equation. Put serious time into the wording to get it right. It should be snappy while giving the benefit customers will receive from using your service.
The subheader then fills in the details further, adding on to the header. It clarifies who could benefit from the service you offer and why your service or product is effective.
The supporting image(s) provide a bit of evidence for the header and subheaders. Make sure it signifies your main ideas, or shows the product or service in action.
Now that you have the basic outline and some rules to follow, let’s give you some key ways to write an awesome value proposition.
Tips to writing the best value proposition possible
1. Research your competition and differentiate from them
“The weakness of an enemy forms part of your own strength.” – Anonymous
It will be pretty tough to highlight a potential difference between you and a competitor if you don’t understand what kind of offerings the competition has.
Therefore, make sure to be thorough in analyzing and researching your direct competition, particularly when it comes to their value proposition.
Once you’ve got a clear point of reference, look for ways to pivot off of it and offer something new or different. This really shouldn’t be that hard, considering you have a complete breakdown of the competition’s offering.
Remember also that you’re trying to break free from a few different brands. Trying to be 100% different from 100% of the competition is impossible and a mistake.
Put yourself into the potential buyer’s shoes during this process. If you were considering a new product or service, wouldn’t you visit quite a few different homepages during your search?
The answer to that is most likely ‘yes’, so keep that in mind when creating your proposition – the customer will see other webpages and will pick whichever stands out and helps them most.
Finally, make sure your pivot from the competition isn’t a change-of-direction for the sake of ‘being different’. Keep your creative shifts helpful to the customer first and foremost.
2. Understand your audience and use the best voice for them
“The best marketing strategy ever: CARE.” – Gary Vaynerchuk
The best value propositions truly connect with their target audience because they’re written in a voice that resonates with them.
Before this is possible, you’ll need to deeply understand your audience. This goes beyond researching some data and discovering demographics.
You need a comprehensive profile that gives you real insight about the customers. This should include what type of person they are, how to best speak to them and what kind of stuff is important to them.
Now consider how well your value proposition will connect with this audience. Sometimes, this part of the process is almost common sense. For example, if you’re coming out with a new vacuum cleaner, chances are you don’t want a value proposition that speaks to a youthful, tech-driven audience.
On the other hand, if you’re developing an AI robot vacuum, maybe the best proposition voice is best aimed at a youthful, tech-driven group.
3. Create a rundown of the different benefits you can offer
Before we can make the language and vocabulary of our proposition fit together, it’s important that all the potential benefits we can offer are accounted for.
The best way to do this is by making a list, and if necessary, inputting them into something that illustrates them clearly.
Divide the benefits into subsections that better define them. For example, if one of the benefits is ‘fun’, put it under the human benefits. If one of the benefits is ‘organizes’, place it in the practical pile.
Chances are you won’t include every benefit into the proposition, but this method ensures you don’t forget an important one.
4. Create a value proposition canvas
A value proposition canvas is one of the most effective tools to guide your proposition-writing process. It’s so valuable because it helps you visualize customer needs and the different ways you can meet these needs.
So, what is a value proposition canvas? It is a visual graph that is split between potential customer issues and how a brand might address these. Below is an example canvas. The setup can change but yours should generally look like mine.
I’ll break down each section of the canvas to give you a better idea of how it works.
Customer profile
- Gains – This includes things that would make a customer’s job easier and more efficient.
- Pains – This includes things that prevent a customer from completing their task.
- Jobs – This is the job the customer is trying to get done.
Value proposition
- Gains Creators – How you can help the customer achieve gains.
- Product/Service – The products you offer that will help the customer.
- Pain Managers – Ways you can help overcome customer pains.
It’s up to you to start adding things to your own canvas. As you do, it will become a lot clearer what types of things to target when writing a brand value proposition.
5. Optimize your layout
“Almost all quality improvement comes via simplification of design, manufacturing… layout, processes, and procedures.” – Tom Peters
The most minor of differences completely change the way someone feels about your value proposition. That’s not to say the layout is more important than the message, but it does hold serious weight.
The good thing is, it’s common sense to understand what looks ‘good’ or not. For example, if you saw a giant paragraph on the page with no lines separating any of it, you’d be turned off.
Take that same paragraph, however, and break it up using multiple paragraphs or bullet points and you’ll have a much easier time reading it.
Follow these principles with your value proposition as well. Now, don’t confuse the above concept with the idea that less is always more – that’s not the point. Instead, the idea is that appearance and structure is the key.
Everyone will have their own preferences, and that’s fine as long as they stay within some reasonable guidelines:
- Keep the text from getting too lengthy, but make sure you give enough information about the value your service delivers.
- Bullet points or other short, informative sentences are easy to absorb.
- Include as much as you can about the product or service so the reader has very few questions after reading the proposition.
Consider the positioning of your value proposition and how it syncs with the rest of the homepage. Determine whether the layout will detract or add to the potential power of the proposition.
Bonus – ad lib your way to a powerful brand value proposition
Similar to the value proposition canvas, this is a fast way to come up with effective ideas. Ad libs are a way to see how different thoughts sound in an overall greater grouping.
Here’s an example of an ad lib template for a value proposition. Feel free to create your own, or if you want, use one of the many available ones online. I used Strategyzer’s template, as I feel it was the best version.
This template, available here, gives you a good example of how helpful the ad lib method could be. Simply fill in the relevant details and see what it ends up giving you. I recommend filling out a few different ones to have some differentiation.
Now that you have the foundational details to create a brand value proposition, let’s look at some examples.
Examples to help inspire your writing
I’ve selected three example propositions that creatively capture the importance of this practice. Use these cases to find your own creative spark.
1. unbounce
Service: Expert webpage-building.
For who?: Tech-limited companies.
Pain manager: No coding knowledge necessary.
The above photos are all three from the unbounce homepage. Notice what they did? They created a three-pronged header for their proposition.
The text reads ‘Convert More’ and then switches between ‘Customers’, ‘Sales’ and ‘Leads’, while changing the image but keeping the subheader and call-to-action the same.
This stood out to me, and I liked how they explained their features in detail.
2. Spotify
Service: Digital music.
For who?: Everyone.
Pain manager: No credit card required.
What stands out to me about Spotify’s proposition is mostly the layout. The value proposition is in complete contrast with the other visual elements. Even though the text is short, it’s catchy, informative and says what it needs to.
3. Fundly
Service: Digital funding.
For who?: Individuals and nonprofits.
Pain manager: No raising requirements or startup fees.

Also, they present some key benefits that help them differentiate from other funding platforms, such as no raise requirements.

December 27, 2019|
Brand value pyramids offer a unique way for companies to share their goals and ideals with team members in a visual fashion. Think of it as a supplement to a mission statement. Use this guide to help you create and maintain your own brand value pyramid.
What is a brand value pyramid?
Brand value is a measurement of the financial value of a company. As a business creates more wealth, its brand value increases. Its value further increases the more it separates itself from its competition. As more customers choose a specific company’s service over competitors, their brand value increases.
A brand value pyramid is a representation of the importance of each type of a company’s specific brand ideals. It’s a diagrammed outline that gives a visual reference of a company’s values that can be quickly shared to all members of an organization.
Why should you build one?
It should first be pointed out that it’s easy to find brand pyramid models through online searches. In fact, a company could adapt one of these models and succeed with it. However, the most likely positive result would be these models act as a guide to help you build your own pyramid. That doesn’t mean it’s unwise to look at other company’s models – it might be helpful to see others before beginning your own.
Building your own brand value pyramid allows the opportunity to create a structure of importance for certain tasks and ideas. This informs the entire organization what types of things should be valued, essentially. As more team members adhere to the pyramid you created, your goals and ideals will be presented more consistently. Now that you understand why it’s important to have one, here’s how to construct a brand value pyramid.
How to construct a brand pyramid
The most important thing to remember during this entire process is that your pyramid mirrors your company’s values. The only way to truly get team members to buy into the values of your company is by creating a pyramid that correctly weights the important items. With that out of the way, let’s make sure you comprehend the pyramid model. The bottom of the pyramid has things that you value but they’re of least concern compared to everything else. At the top are your most valued goals and ideals.
Another thing to note is the top of the pyramid, though it contains the most ideal values, is the most challenging to achieve. This should be noted during both the construction of the pyramid and when referencing it. Certainly, it would be great if an ideal goal like customer connection, for example, were always achieved; but it’s clearly easier to make a cheap, accessible service for customers. Accept this and adapt your model accordingly or face difficult, unreasonable challenges throughout your journey.
When building your pyramid, list out things your company does that are important. Determine the true mission, values and goals. Once completed, use this list to start piecing together parts of your pyramid, starting with the top and moving down. It helps if you use a drawing to visualize where you’re placing things. After you construct your entire brand value pyramid, there are a few more steps to be taken.
What’s next in the process?
There are typically two logical steps that follow creating a brand value pyramid, both are aimed to get the best out of the creation. The first is implementation and the second is re-evaluation.
Implementation
The obvious next step after creating a pyramid is implementing it, though your efforts should go beyond simple implementation. You want to morph the diagram into a remembered, observed thing for team members. Maybe the initial revealing could be backed up by a few meetings to get the ball rolling but ultimately you want the pyramid to be a thing everyone knows without constant reminder.
Evaluation
Once everyone has a firm understanding of your brand value pyramid, the next phase is constantly re-evaluating the model. Are the right things being valued in your model? Have things changed since the creation? Does it need to be updated? Make sure you continuously check on it to make sure it doesn’t lose its importance.
A brand value pyramid is an amazing opportunity to easily spread company ideals to each team member. Create it with this in mind and you’re sure to succeed."

December 9, 2019|
Brand value is a great way to assign worth to a company. However, this is only a small part of the equation. Learn what brand value is, how it relates to brand equity and how you can improve yours. Here’s an in-depth breakdown to get you started.
What is brand value?
Brand value is calculated in a lot of ways. At the most basic level, brand value is a measurement of financial worth a company retains. The more a business makes or is worth monetarily, the higher their brand value.
On a deeper level, brand value is a measurement of company worth in relation to competition. For example, how much more customers will pay for a service from one company over another. Sometimes this decision is based on quality, other times it’s based on memories and perception.
How is brand value different than brand equity?
Brand value and equity relate to each other but are different in a lot of ways. Brand value gives a definitive estimation of a company’s worth. Whether determined financially or through customer preferences, it shows a clearly defined difference between one company and another.
This is different from brand equity, which instead is measured in a much more abstract fashion. Brand equity defines the influence a brand has on a customer base. It should of course be pointed out that a strong brand equity can build a strong brand value. Just because the two things are different, doesn’t mean they can’t influence each other. Keep this in mind when considering brand decisions.
Why is it important?
Clearly, boosting your brand value overall boosts the worth of your company. This alone makes it important. Even though this is the most basic of reasons, it’s the most important. Once we dig a little deeper, however, we see there’s a lot more to it. Creating brand value does things for a company that aren’t always noticeable on first glance.
One of the most important things to remember about brand value is context. Here’s an example showing why context is so crucial. Let’s say your company’s new sock product brought in one million dollars in one year. Without any other context, this is a pretty good haul. However, every other sock company on the market made fifty million in one year with their new sock products. Now your production seems pretty awful. This is one of the biggest parts of brand value that can’t be understated. It helps companies understand not only how much money their brand is worth, but also it shows them how much it’s worth compared to the competition.
How to build your brand value
There are a lot of different ways to build brand value and a lot of them are subjective. However, there’s definitely a few things that stand out. One thing is to make use of technology in order to boost communication and collaboration. There’s so many new tools that allow companies to be creative and get team members working toward a single goal. This gives strong chances to boost brand value.
Another way is differentiation from other brands. This should occur not only when it comes to numbers and statistics but also creativity and presence. Keep your company logo, font and style unique to continually build up your brand value.
Remember that brand value is much more than just a financial report. It’s an overall comparison to your competitors and a perception of worth to your customers. Build around this fact to succeed."
98,https://www.canto.com/blog/brand-voice/,"Brand voice: How to define yours and stand out from the rest
December 1, 2022|
No matter if your brand is just starting out or looking for a brand personality refresh, defining your brand’s voice can leave a big impact. Your brand voice is the catalyst for connecting with an audience and, over time, it has the potential to create deep and lasting relationships with your customers.
What is brand voice?
Brand voice is defined as the personality a brand displays across all of its different channels. A brand’s voice is unique and represents how customers perceive and engage with the business. The voice is present throughout different kinds of content on the brand’s website, social media platforms, campaigns, and even sales collateral. When looking for ways to rebrand, visual factors like a logo, color palette, font selection, and iconography should also be taken into account as factors that can shape brand voice.
For example, if your logo consists of bright colors, the customer might perceive the brand as fun and lighthearted. On the flip side, deeper shades may come across as serious and professional. When working with written content, brand voice could feature casual language and cultural references or it may take a more formal approach.
Brand voice vs brand tone
The terms “brand voice” and “brand tone” are often used interchangeably, but they refer to very different concepts. Brand voice is always an extension of your brand’s personality. It reflects your brand values, goals, and unique point of view. Brand tone, on the other hand, refers to the ways you express that personality across different channels and audiences.
While your brand’s voice should always be consistent, brand tone can (and should) change depending on the message you’re delivering. Brand tone can shift to accommodate many different situations while still embodying the fundamental aspects of your brand voice.
Why establishing your brand voice is important
A strong, distinctive brand voice is vital for building a brand identity that stands out from the crowd. While a company can certainly go to market without developing a brand voice, it will usually struggle to gain traction and mindshare in a competitive media landscape.
Here are a few reasons why you can’t afford to leave your brand voice to chance:
Increases brand awareness
A unique brand voice helps organizations break through the noise so that customers will recognize them quickly and remember them when it matters most. There’s an age-old marketing principle that it takes an average of seven interactions with a brand before a customer will make a purchase. Increasing brand awareness speeds that process along by creating more interactions across the digital landscape.
Builds trust
Customers are more likely to buy from brands that they know and trust. In fact, one recent survey found that 81 percent of customers needed to trust a brand before they could buy from them. Another study found that 46 percent of US customers would actually pay more to buy from a brand they trusted.
Helps you be consistent
Without a defined brand voice, your messaging can come across as confusing and unprofessional. You might think that no one will notice such irregularities, but research has found that presenting your brand consistently can increase revenue by as much as 33 percent.
Clarifies your values
Company values have a major impact on customer behavior. Over the last decade, customers have taken a keen interest in what organizations claim to stand for, with research showing that 77 percent of customers prefer to buy from companies that share their values. Refining your brand voice can make your purpose and mission clear to customers looking to build a lasting relationship that matters to them.
How to find your brand’s voice
While finding your brand’s voice may seem like a difficult task, there are a few things you can do to hone your voice into something that embodies your brand. Identifying your target audience, thinking about the future, and articulating your core mission and values can go a long way toward determining how to position your brand’s voice.
Research your target audience
If your brand is built around appeals to a specific demographic, it’s important to pinpoint what type of messaging will connect with that target audience. If you aren’t sure of your brand’s audience, it can easily be found through surveys and research.
For example, if you find your brand is more geared toward the Y and Z generations, using an informal voice in content might be a good fit. If your brand draws in Generation X and older, a more formal voice could be the order of the day.
No matter your findings, brainstorming what will resonate with your target audience can help guide your brand in the direction of finding what voice will be the best fit.
Think about the future
On a similar note, you will want to make sure your brand’s voice is something that can stand the test of time. Having an evergreen brand voice means that your voice will remain vibrant and relevant in any situation.
Avoid leaning too hard into the current trends dominating social media or popular culture. You don’t want your brand to feel dated or out of touch as those trends evolve. Be true to your values and develop a personality that reflects them so your brand will stand on its merits regardless of changing tastes.
Don’t ignore brand values
If you investigate every brand on the market, you’ll find that core values and mission statements are usually at the center of their messaging. That’s why identifying these foundational elements is a great way to find your brand’s voice!
When you are focusing on your core values and your overall mission in each piece of messaging content, it’s easier for audiences to understand what your brand stands for. If your brand already has established values, you’ll need to figure out how your brand’s voice is going to reflect them. When your brand voice echoes your organizational values, it gives audiences something to remember as well, which increases both your brand’s credibility and chances of acquiring a larger following.
Best practices as you build your brand voice
With so many brands out there, defining your own voice sets your business apart from the competition! Without a way to connect and relate to your audience, your brand can easily get lost in the noise. Even if your brand sits in a super competitive market, sharing your brand’s purpose and personality can be what keeps a customer coming back.
Make the most of your brand voice by following a few best practices:
Make your voice heard
With a good idea of what your brand voice will be, it’s time to start using it! Weaving in brand voice can be easily done through content like blog posts, email campaigns, newsletters, social media platforms, and even photo and video elements. Your team should map out which channels work best to implement your unique voice and start working toward gaining visibility.
Don’t forget to use your brand voice to create messaging for both established and new customers. During the pandemic, 75 percent of US consumers tried a new brand, so it’s critical that you’re always looking to make a good first impression!
Keep it consistent
Since it’s important to maintain consistency, you’ll want to make sure everyone is on the same page. One way to align teams is to create brand guidelines for writing in the specific brand voice so that everyone has a reference point to fall back on if needed. Brand guidelines are also helpful when collaborating with external contributors who may not be familiar with your brand but need to produce content that aligns with your existing messaging.
Another way to keep the brand voice consistent is to assemble a review team for all written content, establish feedback, and finalize copy in the brand voice before sending it to the consumer.
Stay engaged
The best brands are just as good at listening as they are at talking. They don’t just churn out self-centered, tone-deaf content that shows your brand isn’t interested in building genuine relationships with customers. Instead, they use content to start a conversation and create connections that endure over time. This is especially important on social media where brands are expected to interact with customers in ways that feel authentic and respectful.
Social monitoring tools can help you keep your finger on the pulse of conversations related to your brand. By staying engaged and responding when appropriate in your brand voice, you can build trust and credibility with customers as a brand that’s interested in something more than getting people to click or purchase.

Benefits of starting your own branding blogs
As you know, effective branding creates recognition, customer loyalty and other powerful benefits. Similarly, a branding blog has benefits of its own, such as creating excitement around your own ideas, products and services, attracting new customers and more.
A helpful blog inspires readers, turns them into customers and becomes a valuable part of the marketing process, which in turn helps advertise and promote different products and services.
The best blogs out there, as you saw from the seven examples above, have the ability to turn readers into believers of a brand through the power of stories and ideas.
The articles you create within your blog, if they’re unique and creative enough, have a chance to make readers become customers. Furthermore, the blog could make customers into lifelong patrons.
As you can see, there are plenty of solid reasons to start your own branding blog. The following three are most commonly referenced when doing so:
- Boosts your authority. When you create a blog article, you fuel the idea that your brand is at the forefront of its industry, with innovative ideas and expertise. This helps build authority.
- Builds SEO. Believe it or not, a blog is a large part of improving your SEO. Many of the articles will improve the pages you want customers to find on search engines.
- Informs customers. Just as a blog can create new customers, it can also inform current ones about all the latest happenings and goings on of the company.
When it comes to creating a branding blog, it’s important to get all the little details right. Let’s next look at some strategies to help you in the process.
7 dynamic strategies for creating your own branding blogs
The one thing to remember about creating a branding blog is the idea that expertise and experience alone won’t make a blog successful.
There are many different factors that go into building a blog that has loyal followers. Here are the seven most helpful tactics to get you on the right path to success.
1. Inconsistent visuals are impossible to forgive as a reader
You’d be surprised at how important visual consistency is when it comes to a blog. In fact, most readers are not going to return if the visuals aren’t uniform.
The key to getting return readers to the blog is providing the same level of unique qualities in each article. If the visuals throw off this rhythm, no amount of quality content will make up for it.
Make sure things like logos and other visual elements are in the same spot from one blog to the next.
2. Give the readers a reason to believe in your expertise
Even known experts struggle creating trusted articles for their audiences, due to the fact that expectations are much higher when it comes to the written word.
Fortunately, there are ways to ensure your blog is seen by its target audience as an authority on a wide range of topics:
- Treat each article with care. This goes beyond making sure the content is fresh, exciting and accurate. You need to be certain that readers won’t run into simple errors from one paragraph to the next. If a mistake is found, it’s forgivable. If numerous mistakes are found, your authority diminishes.
- Increase research efforts. What better way to show expertise than by actually studying the topics you write about? As the amount of research you put into each article increases, the writing becomes more accurate as well.
3. Stay true to yourself
Part of branding in general is the idea that staying true to your values is important. Similarly, a branding blog should be true to your personal style.
Think about the way in which your articles are written – the voice, the layout, the structure. How drastic is the change of these elements from one piece to the next?
This isn’t to say that unique writing styles shouldn’t be encouraged from each blog contributor. However, there should be a general adherence to some type of specific style.
A brand style guide works wonders on keeping everyone true to the brand’s main values.
4. Titles drives interest, intrigue and success
“The first thing you learn when you’re blogging is that people are one click away from leaving you.” – Alex Tabarrok
If you end up naming the blog, the title is much more important than most people think. This is because it sets the tone for each article contained in the blog.
It’s also the very first thing people see when considering if the blog is worthy of their time. If it’s not catchy, they might go elsewhere.
Here are some key things to adhere to when it comes to titles:
- Determine if it should reflect your products/services or something else
- Use the creativity of your employees to come up with something special
- Don’t go overboard on a flashy title – sometimes simple is best
5. Pictures are way more important than you think
Many different considerations should be placed on the images you use in each of your blog’s articles. Make sure that they are not simply an afterthought to the content.
Here are the main things to remember about blog pictures:
- Images represent your brand. Some pictures are an obvious mismatch with our brand values and ideals, but other times it’s not so clear. As long as you make a conscious effort to choose on-topic, appropriate images, your chances of making a big mistake in this regard are slim.
- Consistency is relevant. When selecting, editing and cropping images, consistency with other past images selected should be at the forefront of your mind. The audiences will expect a certain size and look to the pictures they see on your blog.
6. If teaching, don’t hold back your secrets
“You can buy attention (advertising). You can beg for attention from the media (PR). You can bug people one at a time to get attention (sales). Or you can earn attention by creating something interesting and valuable and then publishing it online for free.” – David Meerman Scott
The only way for a branding blog to be truly helpful and successful is by being as valuable to the reader as possible.
Your audience is likely to sense when you are giving them a cookie-cutter message or withholding your biggest branding secrets from them.
The obvious solution, then, is to give them everything. They will keep coming back for more and you will both benefit.
7. Structure content into helpful categories
Lastly, a blog can be an overwhelming thing to navigate, especially one that has been around for a while.
A search function is nowhere near helpful enough to let reader’s find what they need. Instead, you’ll want to organize content by category.
Determine the most relevant and common topics you discuss, then divide your pieces into labeled sections accordingly.
Bringing it all together
Branding blogs are loaded with free advice that often isn’t available elsewhere. Don’t hesitate to take advantage of the information given in these resources.
Furthermore, creating your own branding blogs can help you locate new customers. Follow the above steps to make sure yours is effective.

100,https://www.canto.com/blog/branding-design/,"Branding design – 3 tips to build visual items
November 1, 2019|
Branding design is a crucial part of company success. However, a lot of businesses don’t tackle the concept with confidence. If you’re interested in boosting the visual elements of your company, check out this branding design guide.
What is branding design?
Branding design focuses on building an identity that demonstrates your brand ideals. It deals with the creation of different styles, elements and arrangements in combination to make a company stand out among its peers. Branding design measures the visual output customers tie to a company.
Think of branding design like the layout of a building. The way a building is constructed says a lot about what happens inside of it. We expect certain things out of a giant warehouse building, just as we make assumptions about a small, cozy place. Branding design attempts to make customers assume something positive about a company based upon design elements.
Now that you have a good idea what branding design is, here are three tips to follow:
1. Incorporate style into the process
When we think of design, we often only imagine visual elements and how they appear. We generally overlook another important part of the design process: style. Each company has a style which they uphold through different design elements, newsletters, logos and mottos.
One of the most important things to remember throughout your entire branding design process is to craft projects and visual elements that complement your brand style. For example, if your business sells candles, leaves and autumn-based items, a logo that portrays a hot summer isn’t going to fit.
2. Focus on the visually-pleasing
The ideal branding design attempts to capture the most aesthetic aspects into key company elements. The most important piece of the puzzle is the logo. Once you’ve pinpointed the type of style needed, the next thing to figure out is how to visually portray the logo. For example, if your company focuses on uncluttering customer tasks, a logo with an overwhelming array of graphics could send mixed signals.
Another lesser-utilized tool is the font of your brand. Though it might not be prudent to use the exact same typography style in each advertisement space, it’s still valuable to generally sync fonts. If the logo has text in a particular font type, try to use the same font for titles of newsletters and other advertisement titles.
3. Analysis is key
It’s easy to forget that branding design is a process that must be cultivated through different phases and methods. One of these important phases is the analysis phase. In order to create materials that coincide with company ideals, research is needed. Begin each design project by analyzing the available data about successful brand designs and customer needs.
Part of this phase involves studying the market and the potential markets where your products and services will attempt to reach. If direct competitors have succeeded or failed within certain markets, take note of their branding design campaigns. These are the types of things you need to study in order to succeed.
Branding design will help change the way customers perceive your brand. Make sure that you build a foundation before diving into the subsets of visual elements."

The following is a complete guide to branding in 2020. If you’re looking for some exciting, fresh ideas, you’re in the right place.
Chapter 1 – The basics of branding
In order to understand branding fundamentals, you first need to understand what a brand is.
What’s a brand?
A brand is a trait or unique feature that establishes a differentiation between different organizations. A brand is the feeling and quality of experience customers have when dealing with a company in any capacity. It is usually made up of elements such as logos, visual designs, tone, voice, taglines and more.
What is branding?
Branding is a marketing process that develops a brand by using different elements like logos, color schemes, values and more to positively influence customers. Branding helps audiences distinguish a brand and gives them good reason to use their services over the competition’s.
Why is branding important?
Branding draws clear differences between your company and competitors. A recognizable, trustworthy brand is an important catalyst for strong campaigns, customer loyalty and showing authority.
A brand is an asset in and of itself. It drives your marketing, creates passionate customers and boosts recognition.
The following is a list of some of the key ways branding empowers organizations:
- Supercharges marketing campaigns. Branding is one of the main driving forces behind every new marketing campaign and project. As branding improves, so does each new initiative.
- Increases team member involvement. Powerful branding attracts quality job applicants and strengthens team harmony. Give your teams something to be a part of and proud of and they’ll respond positively.
- Guides consumer spending. People often disregard things like quality and price in favor of brands. There’s a reason you see so many Macbooks despite a higher price tag than similar laptops from competitors.
- Creates or builds upon a company persona. Branding is a way to mold the face of your company. This gives consumers a personalized connection that they can trust.
Now that you have the basics of branding down, and you understand why it’s so important, let’s dive into the different ways you can improve your branding.
Chapter 2 – Brand management
Once we have a brand in place, we need to make adjustments and maintain it. That’s where brand management comes into the equation.
Brand management is a way to improve a company’s unique products and services, as well as their brand perception. It can affect pricing practices, improve customer loyalty and further overall brand awareness.
Effective brand management increases brand awareness, creates customer loyalty and boosts customer advocacy.
Brand management is a marathon, not a sprint. It requires extensive evaluation and constant evolution in order to be successful. Here are some ideas to improve your brand management.
1. Create, evaluate and use a unique selling proposition
Your unique selling proposition (USP) is one of the biggest chances you’ll get to stand out from your competition. Chances are your product or service is similar in many ways to most competitors. A USP informs consumers that it’s completely different.
One of my favorite examples of a USP is Tivo’s ‘TV Your Way’ slogan. This simple USP let consumers know that watching TV around a schedule was a thing of the past, since Tivo allowed recording of live television digitally.
To create your own USP, determine the ways in which your product or service is different. Then, come up with a catchy way to express this differentiation.
2. Take inventory of your brand assets
Brand assets are highly important and require specific attention. Make sure you have a firm grasp of how your brand assets are currently performing. The following are some crucial assets to consider:
Visual elements. Your specific visuals, such as logos, color schemes, layouts and images are assets. In fact, they’re quite powerful when used correctly. Consider how valuable it can be to slap a popular logo onto a product – sales typically follow. Keep this in mind when crafting and making changes to your visual elements.
Messaging. Brand messaging is how you describe the unique features of your brand. It focuses on the brand’s core values.
Messaging is such an important asset because of how it affects consumers. As your tone and messaging become familiar to your target audience, each new campaign will be that much more effective.
3. Put a plan into place
Planning is a crucial component of brand management. Make sure you’ve put together a detailed layout of how you want to tackle things like evaluation, organization and technology. A plan may also outline the decision to outsource brand management tasks.
Whatever your ideal process is, make sure it’s laid out clearly for all to see. When it comes to evaluation, keep a running list of brand elements and change it when necessary.
When considering technology, look for tools that supplement your most important brand management processes. For example, a brand style guide is an effective way to keep your organization’s standards in place.
An underrated aspect of planning is the communication and re-evaluation involved. Be sure to inform necessary team members throughout the process. Schedule future evaluations of your plans to adjust for all potential changes.
Now that you have some ideas for how to manage your brand, let’s take a look at a way to stand out – brand identity.
Chapter 3 – Brand identity
Let’s consider for a moment how we want our audience to view our brand. If our company had its own personality, what would it be?
A brand identity is the way we present ourselves, as a business, to consumers. This is done through brand values and messaging. Brand identity is created through visual elements such as logos and fonts, which help present a personality to consumers.
A strong brand identity gives our target market the right ideas about our brand. It helps demonstrate that we are unique and exciting with a personality they can relate to.
So how do we create our own successful brand identity? Here are a few key hints to get you started.
1. Review competitors
If Pepsi presented itself as a healthy choice for cola consumption, and its sales skyrocketed, Coca-Cola would likely follow suit.
Researching the competition to see how others succeeded is a necessity to stay relevant and get ahead.
That isn’t to say that you should be copying successful brands and molding your identity to mimic theirs. Rather, it’s a way to see the ways in which they’ve built a solid brand and come up with your own path to that end result.
When researching competing brands, some key factors to consider are how did they influence brand perception, what kind of visual elements did they use and what were the circumstances surrounding their decisions?
Answer these questions and you’ll be able to pinpoint a way to create your own successful identity.
2. Maintain tone
Part of brand identity is portraying your brand as something, whether it be with certain personality or character traits.
Dodge trucks are presented with a hard, tough tone. Apple products are advertised using modern, creative language. In what way does your tone determine your identity?
Whatever it may be, it has to be maintained throughout each new project and campaign. There is always room for changes and innovative new ideas that result in a new tone. However, this is rare and should be carefully examined before implementing.
Ultimately, you don’t want to confuse your target market. If your tone is one of fierce, extreme demeanor in one advertisement, the following ad shouldn’t be a soft, fluffy tone.
3. Make necessary changes
It’s difficult to present the exact same brand identity over extended periods of time. The reality is the world we live in changes quickly. Words, concepts and images lose their meaning and become completely different.
The only way for our identity to be successful throughout these changes is through calculated adaptations.
Phillips ran a noticeable campaign in the late 90s that used a Beatles song ‘Getting Better’ as their brief jingle to coincide with their slogan. Just as disco died, so did rock music, in favor of electronic or rap. Similarly, Phillips no longer used a rock song as their jingle.
If your brand identity is working flawlessly and sending the right message, that’s great, but remember that tomorrow, it could be ‘dead’ or have a completely new meaning, so be prepared to adapt.
Behind all the fancy logos and catchy jingles is the identity you put forth. If it doesn’t reach its intended audience and make a real connection, it’s all for naught. Make sure you do your research to make sure it does.
Now that you’re putting forth an identity that represents your brand, let’s focus on staying consistent.
Chapter 4 – Brand consistency
Once you’ve built the foundations of your brand, it’s time to focus on the importance of being brand consistent.
Brand consistency is the methodology and structure in place to guarantee messaging and other elements stay true to original brand values and ideals. Brand consistency gives your target market a chance to familiarize and connect to your brand, since it’s constantly delivering the right message to them.
Staying consistent increases overall credibility, satisfies customer expectations, builds loyalty and simplifies marketing tasks.
Here are some key ways to maintain consistency:
1. Make sure all teams are involved
Your brand will only be as consistent as the teams who build projects and campaigns using branded materials and assets.
It’s one thing to make sure all authorized parties are granted access to important branded materials. It’s another to ensure they’re used correctly and by everyone who represents the brand.
One way to accomplish this is by adding a system of tests or quick audits. For example, each campaign should be reviewed explicitly for any brand inconsistencies.
2. Develop and maintain brand guidelines
It’s a lot easier for teams to stay consistent throughout each project if they’ve been given solid brand guidelines that get updated from time-to-time.
A strong guideline should cover voice, tone, logo usage, fonts, layouts, color schemes and more. Ensure each department has access to the right brand information at all times.
These efforts help brand ideals and values stay on display through thick and thin.
3. Stick to your ideals during tough situations
If you’ve made a habit of something, and this habit has been an overall positive for your customers, don’t abandon it when it’s convenient or when things get difficult.
Think about a time when a brand offered you something important, be it an altruistic commitment, extra service or support. Now, imagine if this brand immediately pulled this service because it was easier for them to do so in a tough situation. How would you feel?
There will be times when your ideals and unique brand features are challenged. When this happens, consumers will expect you to stick with your initial values. If you don’t, they’ll change their opinion of your brand.
After you’ve satisfied the requirements for a consistent brand, you can begin creating wonderful experiences for consumers.
Chapter 5 – Brand experience
A magical life moment can change our outlook forever. Similarly, an experience we cherish might be linked to a brand, connecting us with that brand for the rest of our lives.
Brand experience shapes the way customers think and feel about a brand based on an important past encounter. It creates loyal customers by attaching a positive emotional connection between them and the brand.
If the brand experience you offer doesn’t excite audiences, they’ll forget you over time and move on to other brands.
One example that I find represents a fantastic brand experience is HBO’s escape rooms. Clearly, linking HBO and experience together might be difficult, considering it simply airs a TV show or movie. There’s no real event or interaction.
However, HBO capitalized on a real-life phenomena, the escape room. These were a team-building game in which human participants used clues to get out of a locked room together. HBO took it a step further by recreating rooms from their popular TV shows. This created a brand experience that people would remember forever and link with the HBO brand.
Let’s start building our own brand experience. Here are some helpful strategies.
1. Personalize when possible
The modern user expects personalization on almost all their platforms. If we have the chance to personalize an experience, it’s an absolute must.
Personalizing the experience will make the event more memorable and create a deeper bond between consumers and brand. In contrast, if we don’t meet consumer expectations, they’ll surely seek out brand experiences from brands who will.
Imagine you went to a play every month for five years. The employees at the theater got to know your preferences, and understood that you couldn’t see the stage well if seated too far to the right. As such, every month when you went to the show, they ushered you to a great spot on the left that was perfect for your eyesight.
Now imagine that you visit and no one guides you to the normal seat. In fact, they completely disregard you and you’re left to fend for yourself, eventually sitting on the right side of the theater.
This example shows a direct difference between a personalized experience and not. Make sure your brand uses all tools and technology necessary to cater to consumer needs.
2. Make emotions a goal
If you’ve cried at a movie, chances are you remember the name of it and the scene that brought on the waterworks.
Similarly, if you’ve been terrified at a movie, you probably remember the movie and the scenes that scared you.
Brand experience is bolstered by an emotional response. If the moment is powerful enough to elicit some type of emotion, chances are that person will create a positive connection between a specific feeling (or in this case, emotion) and that brand.
3. Set the right tone
Remember that consumers expect a certain tone from brands, based on their history with them. A popular yoga chain hosting an event likely wouldn’t want to play Metallica during it, as this would send the wrong message and not give consumers the experience they were expecting.
There are many different ways to set the right tone with brand experience. The layout of a physical store, for example, should align with your brand ideals and values. Think of the different ways your brand presents itself, and determine whether it’s sending the right message.
Chapter 6 – Brand positioning
Upon seeing different brand logos or hearing brand jingles, most people think of the types of values, features and positive attributes that specific brand offers.
Is this because the logo design or jingle-tone directly relay a brand’s core values and ideals? Of course not. It’s instead because of how they’ve utilized brand positioning.
Brand positioning is a way to influence a target audience to understand the types of features and values you offer each time they think of your brand. Brand positioning is a strategic approach to present your brand as a superior option.
Brand positioning is essentially how a brand demonstrates its positive attributes in regard to the types of things their target market finds valuable.
Let’s get started on creating your own unique brand positioning. Here are some key strategies.
1. Craft a meaningful brand positioning statement
A thoughtful brand positioning statement is one of the most basic, powerful ways to create effective brand positioning.
A brand positioning statement is a way to define your brand – what it does, who it helps, how it helps them and more. This gives team members a clear outline of how to behave throughout projects.
Make sure the statement is direct and clear. A typical mistake is creating a statement that is too vague. “We work hard to be great.” is an example of a much-too-broad statement. All brands try to be great. Be more unique and specific.
Another misunderstood concept with the brand positioning statement is it’s not a slogan or statement to the public. The brand positioning statement is for internal use only.
2. Create a brand positioning map
Brand positioning is impossible without a firm grasp of your target audience’s perception (concerning your products/services vs. competitors).
Therefore, it’s crucial to find a way to zero in on how your audience thinks of your brand.
Luckily, there’s an effective way to do this: build a brand positioning map. This gives us a visual blueprint of where our brand lies in relation to competitors when it comes to different attributes and features.
By creating a map, we give ourselves a better understanding of how consumers perceive us.
The above picture is a brand positioning map I made using my best judgment concerning different peanut butter brands. Note that there are separate quadrants, organizing brands by their benefits and features.
My example shows that PB2 is calorie-dense and expensive, Skippy is expensive and has fewer calories, JIf is a great value and Peter Pan is as well.
When building your own map, include features that are important to your intended audience.
3. Consider the competition and follow paved paths
It’s a lot easier to position your brand once you have an understanding of its direct competition. This implies that you’ll need to research the current market and find potential competitors.
Next, consider the ways in which these brands are positioning themselves. Does what they’re doing seem to be working? If so, how are they accomplishing it? Get a strong understanding of how it’s going for them.
Finally, take this newfound information from your research and apply it to your own positioning. The great thing about this method is you can learn from and avoid other brand’s failures.
Chapter 7 – Brand image
When you have a good understanding of your brand image, everything else seems to fall right into place. Furthermore, this understanding allows you to work toward improving and bettering your image.
Brand image is how a target market feels about a brand. This feeling and perception is influenced by the brand values, ideals and identity. Brand image is largely crafted by customer interactions with brands.
Remember that brand image isn’t something we have direct, total control over. For example, if an automobile brand changes its slogan to, ‘The safest cars available’, it doesn’t mean their audience will agree.
Brand image isn’t how we see ourselves; it’s how our customers see us.
That being said, we can attempt to influence our brand image. In fact, we need to put our best efforts into this process in order to succeed. A good brand image helps with sales, customer loyalty and more.
Here are a few of the most important strategies to positively influence your brand image.
Transform your persona
However successful something is, there’s always room for improvement. This is definitely true with brand personas.
A brand persona is the way brands highlight specific features, values and ideals that are important to them. Personifying a brand makes it easier for consumers to connect with and understand its values.
Even if you have a persona that is working quite well, look for ways to improve it. If you can’t find any, that’s fine. Instead, set up a schedule to evaluate it. This ensures any societal changes don’t throw you off-guard.
Create and unify brand visuals
It’s important that every brand find the right visual elements to match their personal ideals. Just as camouflage matches its surrounding, so do visual layouts and color schemes match a brand’s values.
If your brand wants to promote a environment-friendly lifestyle, colors like blue and green likely work better for it (since the Earth has a lot of blue and green).
Once you’ve come up with the layout schemes, colors, fonts and other visual elements for your brand, it’s important to keep them consistent across all platforms. This requires a unified effort from each department.
One way to ensure visual conformity is to put into place a system that verifies each project meets the requirements.
Consider your brand voice
Similar to a persona, the brand voice is a way to express a certain aura to a target market. Brand voice, like visual elements, needs to stay consistent from campaign to campaign.
Voice reminds people of audible elements, but it extends further to things such as emails, social media and more.
There are a lot of factors that go into voice, which vary from vocabulary to tone and more. Consider how customers will perceive your voice – the attitude and tone it relays.
Think of the different ways your brand could be more human and develop your brand voice accordingly.
Chapter 8 – Brand association
It’s easy to see why brands want to be associated with certain attributes, like Facebook to social togetherness or YouTube to individuality and creativity. This connection essentially transforms how people think of a brand. It’s created through brand association.
Brand association happens when certain brand traits are entrenched in a customer’s mind. The ideal situation is for these traits to be positive rather than negative. Brand association creates value and equity by making consumers aware of their quality.
As important as creating positive brand association is, it’s crucial you remember that this is a delicate process that takes planning and effort. Putting a tank next to a dozen eggs in an advertisement won’t make people associate your eggs with the strength of a tank.
Let’s take a look at some ways to create your own brand associations.
1. Understand when and where to use visuals
Just as a skull and crossbones doesn’t belong on breakfast cereal boxes, neither do your brand visuals belong on incompatible locations and campaigns.
Think of ways that your brand elements could influence your target market to create positive associations. Sometimes, your color schemes and layouts do most of the work for you. Other times you need to get creative.
For example, if you have brand colors like orange and black, creating some type of Halloween campaign would be effective.
The last thing to remember when it comes to branded visuals and creating brand associations through them is to respect and understand your limitations.
2. Introduce the right language and vocabulary
An advertisement that uses the wrong language is usually a disaster, even if it’s unnoticeable to the creators. For example, an ad for an MMA fighting event wouldn’t want ‘weak’ language in the promotion, using words such as ‘fun’, ‘happy’, etc.
This type of mistake can create a negative association that fails to accomplish what a brand proposes itself to stand for or value.
Part of creating the right brand association is using the right tone as well. It’s not enough to use consistent vocabulary – you also need a consistent vibe. Think of the way your wording sounds when reading it. Does it relay the values and goals of the brand? Will it get people to create the right type of associations?
3. Introduce personification
Personification brings inanimate objects to life, giving human traits and tendencies to something that does not have them.
Why is this so important? People love connecting with things on an emotional level, but that’s difficult when not everything is humanistic.
Even if a lamp is reliable, chances are you won’t have strong feelings toward it one way or the other if it breaks. However, if you give that lamp a name, attach some fake legs and draw a face onto it, some feelings might arise.
The same goes with your brand. Look for ways to personify things that might influence positive brand associations. Chances are there are a lot of different ways to use this powerful idea immediately.
Use these ideas to create brand associations that bring more customers and followers to your brand. Even the smallest associations can make waves.
Now that you understand brand associations, let’s take a look at the brand awareness concept.
Chapter 9 – Brand awareness
When people see the Coca-Cola logo, they feel comforted, nostalgic, happy and calm. This is definitely not unusual. In fact, most everyone has some type of brand that brings out certain powerful emotions.
Now, it would seem that Coca-Cola would have wanted their logo to make people thirsty, and maybe they originally did. However, their extensive branding heightened their brand awareness.
Brand awareness is when someone recognizes specific brand traits and unique qualities. It is more than just seeing a logo and knowing which brand it belongs to. Brand awareness is a positive quality that indicates success.
So, why is brand awareness so important? For one, it’s a main driver of brand equity. As customers grow accustomed to a certain brand’s quality, they’re willing to pay more for their products over competitor’s.
Another reason it’s so valuable is it helps companies introduce new products and services or enter new markets.
Let’s break down some of the key ways to boost your brand awareness:
Spell out your brand in detail
One of the biggest problems many brands have is that their target market doesn’t understand who they are or what they do. To overcome this, work on making it clear what the brand is all about.
Think about the different ways your brand is presented to audiences. Would they be able to describe it in detail? Could they explain its characteristics?
These types of questions need to be answered in order for a brand to gain true awareness. Put your best features forward and make it clear what your brand stands for at all times.
Focus on content
It’s pretty tough to further our branding efforts without a serious focus on creating amazing content. Remember that people are accustomed to receiving all types of advertisements and clickbait each and every day.
We need to completely disconnect from the mundane and instead overhaul the way our content is delivered and the level of quality it contains.
Don’t put a cap on your creativity! Remember that most people will enjoy something if the overall content is quality. It doesn’t matter if it’s an ad trying to sell something or a random story – the quality is key.
Give audiences a reason to listen
You’re trying to reach out and connect with customers in so many different ways. Take a step back and decide whether your approach is working. Put yourself in the shoes of your recipients and see if these methods would please you or be off-putting.
In what ways are you connecting with audiences? Does this connection feel like an attempt at a sale or a friendly check-in?
This doesn’t mean you have to personalize everything or avoid conversations about sales. Instead, it’s simply a reminder that brand awareness isn’t built by bludgeoning our customers with boring newsletters that offer no personal connection.
Chapter 10 – Brand authenticity
When most people picture a brand that they want to connect with, it is always, at the very least, sincere. The brand is truthful, honest, genuine and real.
I’m not alone in these requirements, either. It’s common for brands to be evaluated first and foremost on brand authenticity by their audiences.
So, what is brand authenticity? It’s the result of a brand that sticks to its values and is honest with its customers. An authentic brand goes out of its way to keep lines of communication open to customers while showing that it really cares.
Brand authenticity allows companies to thrive in situations where others may struggle. Customers continue to purchase products and services from brands who are authentic.
Here are some ways to build up your own brand authenticity:
1. Transparency is king – strive for it
It’s pretty tough to be authentic without full transparency. Even if everything you say is true, if you hide anything or fail to answer certain questions, it all falls apart.
This is where things can get tricky: giving a non-answer is unacceptable. A true commitment to transparency requires an all-or-nothing approach. Everything has to be out in the open, otherwise your audience will assume the worst.
A common example of transparency is when McDonald’s began placing the nutritional content of their food onto the packaging.
Whether this decision came from outside pressures or within, it showed true transparency and opened up the possibility of making their brand appear authentic.
2. Remember what’s truly important throughout each campaign and interaction
It’s easy to lose sight of our goals, values and visions from time-to-time. However, it’s important we realign with them immediately to maintain brand authenticity.
Each time we have communication with our audiences, it’s crucial to, on top of being sincere, uphold our brand ideals.
When people think of authentic brands, they generally picture the values brands have and the larger goals they pursue for the greater good.
Every brand campaign, project and communication should reflect this, in some way or the other. Stay honest and true to our ultimate goals to be genuine in the eyes of our target audience.
3. Follow through on everything
If you give customers a special reason to believe in your brand, don’t fail to meet this expectation. This goes for claims, values and product or service specials.
If your brand stands for something, see it through in all situations. Your target audience will absolutely notice if you fail to do so.
When releasing a new line of products, make sure all claims made about them can be met. It’s easy to slip up, but it’s not so easy to gain back customer trust.
The result of your consistency and commitment will be a true customer loyalty and an audience base who believes that you are truly brand authentic.
Chapter 11 – Co-branding
If you’ve ever been on a road trip with someone, you’re probably aware of the idea behind teamwork. On a road trip, it seems like one person drives while the other navigates the map or GPS.
If you and your companion are both great drivers but bad navigators, you don’t make the best team. Similarly, if you both are great navigators but bad drivers, the trip might not go so well. Clearly, the best result is if one is a good driver and the other a good navigator.
The same can be said about brands. Teaming up with another brand has potential to be great or terrible, depending on if you find a good match. This is called co-branding.
Co-branding is an agreement that joins two (sometimes more) companies to create a new product or offer a new service. The reason this works is because they share each other’s brand names, logos and other brand elements.
Co-branding can help brands in many ways, including:
- Entering new markets
- Overcoming potential weaknesses
- Reducing risks
- Maximizing publicity
As you can see, co-branding has some serious potential to help a new product or service succeed. However, it’s not always beneficial. Just like in the ‘drivers and navigators’ scenario above, things can go awry.
Co-branding has a few negative possibilities, such as:
- Bringing in a bad reputation from a different brand
- Financial issues/negotiations
- Opposing cultures
With this in mind, let’s look at some strategies and guidelines sure to put you on the right co-branding path:
1. Make sure you can justify the new product
The idea to co-brand and release a new product has to be backed up by solid reasoning. This is not meant to be some type of stunt or ill-planned strategy.
In order for the co-branding to be successful, you need to ask yourself whether the product or service you’re creating will actually please customers. Keep in mind, adding a new logo to the product doesn’t really add anything for the customer.
There needs to be a concrete reason why the new (or improved) product adds value, otherwise the co-branding will fail.
2. Remember, you’re working with another brand – draw up a concrete proposal
If you’ve ever been in some type of partnership, even if it was brief, you certainly know how quickly a disagreement can send things off the rails. The same goes for co-branding. No matter how well things might be working with our products, there is bound to be some disconnect at some point.
When this happens, you’ll want to be sure that you don’t get taken advantage of. That’s why it’s so valuable to, before the "
o-branding partnership, create some type of agreement. This should specify key details of future potential incidents.,
The most important part of this phase is making the agreement as clear as possible, so that if something goes wrong, there’s no uncertainty over the next steps to take.
3. Consider what each side might bring to the table,,
Two wrongs don’t make a right. With co-branding, two rights don’t always make a right either! What I mean by this is, having two parties that are experts at one thing doesn’t mean the resulting projects they complete will be expert-level.
Oftentimes, two brands that excel at the same thing can’t really work together. It seems strange, but the differences in strategy and theory will likely result in a completely worse result than if the brands had completed a product on their own.
To combat this, you’ll want to select a co-branding partner that is in a similar field but doesn’t do exactly what you do. For example, if you make footballs
Chapter 12 – Rebranding,,
The need for serious change comes and goes, leaving a window of opportunity to create something new or improve on something that already exists.,
When it comes to your brand, minor changes do happen every so often. However, a rebranding pushes everything forward and attempts to build a powerful
Rebranding is the way brands evolve their identity, pushing forward new visual elements and positioning while also showing their audience that the brand is completely different. A rebranding is a comprehensive change that creates a completely different outlook on a brand’s values and goals.,
A rebranding is important for many reasons. Here are some of the main benefits:,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
Now that you see why rebranding is so important, here are some keys to getting it right:,
1. Go the extra mile,,
Part of rebranding is the idea that you’ll come away with something better. This only takes place if your process is comprehensive and coordinated.,,
Remember that you’re not just changing a logo haphazardly; but instead are syncing all branding elements together with a new core concept.,,
The deeper you explore and more coordinated your process becomes, the better the chance of a successful rebrand.,
2. Deepen your understanding of the competition,,
Rebranding isn’t always just about our brand alone. Sometimes, we need to maneuver based on what the competition is doing.,
This makes it very important to research and analyze our competition in order to figure out the ways in which they’re succeeding or not.,,
Once we have some solid information about our competitors, we can then use this information to inject ideas and creativity into our own rebrand, increasing the chance of success.
3. Coordinate everything for consistency,,
An extensive collaboration is a must from all teams for a rebranding to work. Without it, there will be areas where consistency is lacking.,
This often goes beyond during the planning phase of the process, too. It’s important to gather feedback in an effective manner from all types of impacted departments. This will give better insight into if everything is fitting together nicely.,
Finally, make sure that all potential changes are thoroughly understood and there is a detailed plan that provides structure to all the work about to be done.,
4. Evaluate your brand elements,,
Part of rebranding involves changing different brand elements, such as a logo, slogan
As such, take some time to evaluate these elements and decide whether or not they are still relevant within the new values and mission.,
For example, if your brand decides to create a new tone that represents dark, heavy
Chapter 13 – Brand value proposition,,
There’s a lot to be said about first impressions. One of the most common ideas about first impressions is they are very brief! You get a quick chance to make a good one.,,
A brand value proposition is similar. It is a message placed on the entry points of a company webpage, designed to inform specific details about the brand.,
This message details why a customer should select your product or service instead of your competitors. It does this by offering what types of problems you’ll solve for the customer.,,
There are quite a few benefits of creating a successful brand value proposition, including:,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
With so many benefits, it’s clear you should put serious effort into this task. Here are some tips to writing a powerful brand value proposition:,
1. Wording is crucial,,
Included in this idea is the length and structure of the wording. Just like with any other time you write, certain lengths are too long or short. Generally, the brand value proposition should be brief yet long enough to include a lot of details.
As far as the content, it should be catchy and creative but simple at the same time. You don’t want to confuse the readers in the slightest, but you don’t want them to be unimpressed – find a happy medium.
Lastly, stick to the facts and what you’re truly able to offer. Don’t make it sound like you’re trying too hard to convince the customers. This will turn them off.,
2. Include the most important benefits,,
Just because the value proposition is shorter in length, doesn’t mean it can’t be loaded with information.,
Jam as many of the benefits and solutions you offer into the proposition, as this is your best shot of getting customers to stick around.,
It should be pointed out that there’s not really anything wrong with going a bit longer in the text if you need to. As long as you structure everything correctly so it’s appealing aesthetically, readers shouldn’t have a problem.,
3. Consider your presentation,,
The presentation of your statement absolutely matters, and should sync with the rest of the page overall. For example, it should be within the correct color schemes
Also take note of the images used in the background or near the value proposition. Even though they’re not technically a part of it, they do add to it (or take away from it). Keep all images as demonstrations of the services.,
Consider adding things like bullet points and other paragraph-shortening methods to make things a bit more snappy and easier to read. This will give the overall feel of the page a much better touch.,,
Chapter 14 – Brand equity,,
Do you ever wonder why certain brands charge a higher price for similar products? Seems like a strange concept when you think about it.,,
Even stranger is the fact that customers willingly pay these higher prices despite knowing full well that the product is essentially the same.,,
This concept is driven by brand equity, and it’s not going away any time soon, so make sure you’re doing everything you can to increase yours.
Brand equity in a nutshell is how strongly customers trust a particular brand. This adds measurable value to a company and allows them to price goods and services higher because of the brand name attached to them. The better the consumer perception of a brand, the higher the price can be without losing sales.,
Brand equity is responsible for numerous positive benefits, some of which are lesser-known. These typically include:,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
So how do we obtain stronger brand equity to reap these rewards? Here are some key methods:,,
Uphold brand values,,
Brand values give customers a reason to believe in your company, showing them that you truly stand for something. To boost brand equity, we need to maintain these values and show our customers that they extend further than a sale
One way to uphold our values is by creating marketing campaigns that showcase our commitment to them. For example, if our brand stands for helping the hungry, we could create slogans that shed light onto this fact.
Similarly, you can connect your brand values to the products and services you sell. For example, to show you’re committed to helping the hungry
Connect with customers,,
A powerful way to get customers to connect to our brand is by building an authentic relationship with them.,,
We can do this by striking up conversations when possible, through all different mediums. Also, if we’re able to get creative
For example, seeking out ways to increase engagement on things like social media is helpful. Also, adding a personalized touch to a purchase encourages repeat sales.
Remember that customers have different emotions and feelings when they make a purchase from your brand. It’s up to you to guide these feelings toward a positive emotion.,,
Stand out among competitors,,
A large part of brand equity comes from our ability to show why we’re a better fit for the customer than the competition. To best do this, it’s important to evaluate how well our products and services stand out.,
It’s also crucial that we handle this process comprehensively, considering the quality and character that our brand and product represent, then adjusting if necessary.
Continually look for new and exciting ways to create separation from the competition while aiming your brand to meet customer requirements.,,
Chapter 15 – Brand advocate,,
Imagine a random movie executive you’d never heard of published an article in the newspaper exclaiming that the new superhero movie was the best film of all time and an absolute must-see. It’s possible that this encourages you to go out and watch the movie.,,
Now, imagine your best friend tells you that the new superhero movie is the greatest film of all time. Even though your friend might not be a film expert, chances are their recommendation is much more powerful than the newspaper’s.
The above scenario exemplifies how important a brand advocate can be. They promote an idea without incentives, making their opinion seen as much more valuable to their peers.,
A brand advocate spreads the word about a brand through different social media platforms, word-of-mouth and more. They are customers who loved a product and experience so much that they felt obligated to recommend it to others.,
Why are brand advocates so important?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
So how do we find and encourage brand advocates? Here are some helpful methods:,,
Focus on storytelling,,
It’s easy for customers to connect when they see your brand through a creative lens. This is why storytelling is such an effective way to encourage advocacy.,,
Not only does storytelling shift the angle on a brand, it also gives unique insight into what they stand for and how they care about their customers.,
Look for ways to build your own brand story through successful examples, research and data. The more you know about what types of storytelling help a brand, the more in-tune your story will be with customers.
Maintain product quality,,
Too often when seeking to create brand advocates we forget some fundamentals about what makes them tick. It’s great to deliver a fantastic experience to customers, but if the product is lagging behind, there’s zero chance they will recommend it.
And it’s not just about the quality, functionality and durability of the product either, though this is obviously important. It extends to how the product connects to specific customer needs.
For example, you might have a product that is durable over a long period of time. However, if it is lacking a single specific feature that customers want
Find your advocates,,
One misconception about brand advocates is that their promotion allows brands to reap rewards passively and without any effort or engagement.,,
Though there is some truth to this, it disregards the potential for amazing growth. By finding out who our advocates are, we’re able to put them to work
For example, if we find customers willing to rate us highly, share our values and promote our newest products
So how do we actually find an advocate? One way is through surveys and other communicative connections that reach out to customers. Another way is by using tools such as SparkToro that comb social media for us to seek out potential advocates.,,
Chapter 16 – Product branding,,
Product branding is, first and foremost, helpful and informative. In order to give customers quick insight into a product
So what is product branding? It’s a type of branding that promotes a product through things like colors, packaging and more. Product branding helps customers understand key factors about the purchase they’re about to make.,
Before I break down some of the best ways to brand a product, here are a few reasons why product branding is so valuable:,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
How do we go about achieving these benefits? Here are some strategies:,,
Study the target market in-depth,,
If the main consumers of your product are within a certain age range, you’ll want to adapt branding efforts to target their group specifically.,
Similarly, other factors such as their ideals are important to be aware of, as it will also dictate how we brand our product.
Lastly, our research should span both current and potential customers, potentially covering direct competitors and their product branding. Remember that there are times to differentiate and times to follow suit. You’ll make this determination quite a bit as you study competing products.
Create and maintain strong visual components,,
The way you present a product to a customer matters. It signals the potential features, utility and quality of a product. This ultimately influences purchases.,
Think of the way products are packaged. You wouldn’t expect a luxury pen to come in a yellow cardboard box. Instead, it would probably be packaged in a rich, wooden box. The manner you’ve packaged the product as well as the color of the packaging is important and helpful to the customer.
Consider also the font used on the product labels and packaging. What does it relay? Does it signify extremeness? Adventure? Safety? Answer these questions for your customers with an effective visual preparation.,,
Clarify the product’s justification for existing,,
Utility is crucial when branding a product, and just because you know that the product is beneficial and useful, doesn’t mean the customer does.
Determine what it does, what needs it meets and how all of this stands out among similar products. If this information isn’t obvious, try highlighting it in some way or the other.
For some products, justifying it with branding is almost done for the company. Take for example Diet Coke. It’s existence is to provide an alternative cola with no sugar. Remember that not all products will be so straightforward, so be prepared to get creative.
Chapter 17 – Brand loyalty,,
Can you imagine how nice it would be if customers favored your brand over competitors, even after the competition did everything in their power to steal the customer away from you?,
This scenario is a reality for brands who build their brand loyalty correctly.,,
Brand loyalty is when customers use a specific brand’s service, even as situations change. Brand loyalty creates all types of other branding positives, such as brand advocates.
As mentioned above, brand loyalty creates avid brand advocates. What else does it do? Here’s a list of some potential positives:,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
Considering the above advantages, it makes sense to do everything in your power to build brand loyalty. So, how do we go about doing that? Here are some unique methods:
Provide elite customer service,,
Usually, a combination of a quality product and good customer service are required to fully build brand loyalty. Chances are that even if a product is perfect, a bad service experience can still have customers running for the hills.
Part of understanding how to better serve customers is learning their needs, which change from time to time. Interestingly enough, a lot of customer service is now an interaction between human and machine.
However the formula, ensure that the way you tackle serving the customer will align with their values and keep them happy.,
Maintain product quality,,
The first thing that likely created some semblance of loyalty for customers to your brand was the quality of your product or services.,,
Accordingly, it’s going to take a solid effort for this loyalty to both continue and grow. There is some truth to the idea that an inferior product doesn’t matter if enough brand loyalty has already been established. However, this only goes so far.
If your services aren’t keeping up with what the customer wants, and on top of this your competitors are, a potential switch to another brand may happen. Go the extra mile to ensure your product delivers the same powerful results it originally did.
Test out different rewards programs,,
Believe it or not, once a rewards or loyalty program is put into place, it’s not set in stone. In fact
That isn’t to say you should abuse your loyal customers. However, it does give you the opportunity to try out other programs to see if they would better serve everyone.,
When creating these rewards, consider the layout and structure that would keep customers engaged and feeling like they’re involved fully in some type of game or progress. The more they want to ‘play’, the more loyal they become.
Examine consumer trends occasionally,,
What initially created brand loyalty won’t stay the same forever. Consumer habits are dynamic and should be researched as such.,,
Anyone old enough to remember the video store craze also remembers when the internet made it easier to stream and download films. The higher the quality the streams, the lesser need customers had to spend money at a physical location.,
Some brands were able to capitalize on this and adapt, others did not. No matter how much loyalty someone might have had to Blockbuster, they just didn’t deliver the services the customer no wanted
Keep this example in mind as a reminder that no matter how great your service once was, there’s always a possibility it won’t be in the future.,
Chapter 18 – Brand recognition,,
If you’ve paid attention to the recent ‘streaming wars’, it is pretty apparent to you that the once-vacant market has exploded and brands are lining up to compete for customers.,
Streaming options are nearly endless now, and it begs the question: which streaming service will be the last one standing?,
There are a lot of factors that enter into it, but one that stands out in my mind is this: whichever one has the best brand recognition strategies and structures.,
Brand recognition occurs if someone is able to identify a particular brand using elements like colors, sounds, logos and packaging. Most importantly
So what kind of rewards come along with powerful brand recognition? Here are a few to consider:,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
It makes sense, then, that you’d want to work towards building a brand recognition that sticks. Fortunately
Build unique brand visuals,,
It goes without saying that it’s hard to stand out when you aren’t unique or different in some way. Aim your brand visuals to adhere to this concept.,,
Of course, all branded visuals are different. The key here is to be different in a noticeable way. For example, even though Coca-Cola and Pepsi are essentially the same product
Also remember that it’s not simply about being different from the competition. There needs to be creative thought into your designs to represent the brand.,,
Think of why certain aspects should be included and why some should not. For example, a square-shaped logo works great for a boxing/packaging company. It doesn’t work so well for a pudding company.,
When it comes to logos specifically, they need to coincide with your main brand values and ideals in order to be effective.,
Of course, logos aren’t the only visual element that aids the increase of brand recognition. Other visible things such as colors, layout structures and fonts are important in this area too.
Color schemes stand out bigtime, sparking brand recognition for nine out of ten customers when used repetitively.,
Consider the ways your colors and visuals make target audiences feel and adjust accordingly.,,
Don’t forget the importance of audio,,
There’s a lesser-known concept called audio logos, which are essentially jingles. Though not as memorable or recognizable as visuals, audio has a strong tie to recognition.
It’s also a quickly-growing aspect in technology, being used now in all types of smartphone and other tech devices.,
In terms of brands, recognizable audio is everywhere, creating effective links in the minds of customers.
It’s easy to get creative with audio, especially thanks to all the new musical developments that came with new technology. Use the many tools available to build a jingle that sticks.,
Focus on communication through social media,,
It’s not enough to simply show up to the social media ‘party’ in order to make waves. After creating profiles on sites you feel are essential, take the next step: communication.,
The fact of the matter is your brand should be on social media platforms not to get talked to or to talk at people. Instead, it should be there to talk with people. Promote more than a few sales or services with your communications.,
This works wonders for your recognition, especially when you’ve been consistent creating profiles, putting branded materials in place.
Build a creative email newsletter,,
Part of recognition is repetition, and a consistently-sent email newsletter creates that repetition. This is the case only if the newsletter is creative and worth the customer’s time.,
There are two main factors when it comes to this: headlines and content. If the headline is weak, the customers won’t want to open the email.,
The next thing to consider is the content. It’s okay to send out mass emails and offer sales, but if the content isn’t somewhat personalized and interesting, it will prevent customers from opening your newsletters in the future.
Chapter 19 – Brand transparency,,
The concept or brand transparency in the modern landscape seems paradoxical: since it’s so easy to find information these days, every brand is transparent, so how can a brand strive for transparency?
To clear things up, think of it more like this: all brands are transparent by default now. However, some aim to be more available and open
Brand transparency is the attempt a brand makes to be genuine and available. It is often a direct result of honesty in the public spotlight.,,
Brands can work to be open and honest about things like their values, services, products
The following are key ways transparency helps a brand:,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
Building transparency is a process that requires a lot of maintenance, evaluation and strategy. Here are some strategies that will put you on the right path:,
Widen your communicative reach,,
A large part of transparency is the extent of communication a brand participates in. In order to meet this requirement, it’s important to branch out the different ways in which you talk to audiences.,
First, evaluate where you’re mostly coming into contact with target audiences. Then check to see if you’re missing a trendy new spot, website or social media site.
Next, make sure the conversations you’re having are honest, genuine and personal. No one is going to see you as authentic if you respond using an automated
Enhance your feedback systems,,
Improving on your current feedback systems has two benefits: it allows you to stay in-tune with customer needs and complaints, and it helps customers feel more heard, which boosts your overall transparency.
So how do we go about accomplishing this? One way is to examine the structure we have in place for feedback. Are we available on a bunch of different platforms?,,
Next, consider how we’re responding to feedback, both positive and negative. Customers want to be heard and acknowledged. If we ignore negative comments
Think of the ways to be genuine and honest in all of our feedback mediums. It will certainly make the brand appear to be much more transparent.,,
Admit faults when needed,,
It’s okay to make mistakes – every brand does. What matters is the response afterward. If it’s covered up, things get worse, especially today with all the access to information available.
We can’t necessarily try to fix everything, but the honesty we show when necessary gives our target audience a reason to believe that we’re unsatisfied with an error and are doing everything possible to make it right.,
This doesn’t mean that you have to address every little minor error, but you should consider what types of things require a public announcement to correct and make sure you make one.,
Adjust your brand persona,,
Finally, consider the ways in which customers see our brand in all types of situations. If we were human, how would they interact with us?
This has a lot to do with trust. The more human characteristics our brand shows, the more we’ll be trusted.,
So what kind of persona should we try to build? It really comes down to what we expect the target market to want. For example, a skateboarding brand would likely build a youthful persona that isn’t too serious.,
Chapter 20 – Brand compliance,,
If you’re an avid TV show fan, chances are you were one of the 19.3 million people who watched the series finale of Game of Thrones.,
Of those 19.3 million viewers, zero of them knew the ending beforehand. In today’s age of connectedness and instantaneous information, that may seem difficult to believe.
However, it is because the production teams went to great lengths, working together to ensure the details were well-protected.
Brand compliance is a similar concept. Different departments have to come together and all be on board to ensure the branding doesn’t get ‘spoiled’.,,
Brand compliance is one of the key elements in the pursuit of brand consistency. In fact, if upheld at all times, there are many benefits which comes as a result
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
So, how do we go about being compliant? Typically, it involves staying on-point with messaging
With that in mind, you’ll want to follow a structure and strategy designed to uphold compliance at all times. Here are some unique methods to help you reach these goals.,
1. Evaluate your current branding guidelines,,
First things first: you’ll want to build a set of branding guidelines that aims to keep everything consistent.,,
If you’ve already created branding guidelines, that’s great, but they should still be evaluated every now and then to keep up with potential value changes.
Consider if your guidelines are bringing consistency across all channels. If not, locate the places where there is disconnect and brainstorm creative ways to fix it.,
Seek out materials from the latest projects and campaigns to see if everything is meeting branding standards. If it’s not, update the guidelines accordingly.,
2. Assign a team to lead compliance efforts,,
For whatever reason, companies see the value of having managers and overseers for numerous different tasks and goals, but when it comes to brand compliance
Don’t fall victim to this misstep. Make sure that there is a dedicated team or department that is in charge of compliance standards.,,
This may take a little bit of time and effort to get set up, since you want this team to be well-versed in all the values and other elements of your brand. You’ll also need to instruct them of their overall goals and tasks.,
Lastly, make sure they have at least a little bit of oversight. This will ensure everything runs smoothly for all involved.,
3. Examine branding in products and services,,
Our values, ideals and mission generally stays the same for long periods of time. This is because when we set these values, they’re important to us and unlikely to change on a whim.
However, the products and services we produce change quite a bit. Even if the change is a slight adjustment, it still runs the risk of going a bit off brand.
Because of how small of changes the products face, it’s easy to miss a compliance error. That’s why a periodic check ensures consistency.,
With every new update, consider if the service still represents the brand values that customers have grown to love.,
Chapter 21 – Brand differentiation,,
Since the late 1800s, automobiles have pushed the boundaries of transportation. Car companies, as a result
Despite this, none really do. The average customer, in fact
However, Tesla changed all that. They not only committed to creating high-performance electric vehicles, but they also have redefined what car companies do.
For example, in 2018, they sent one of their Tesla cars into space. It even orbited Mars!
This is brand differentiation in action. Many believe that if they just alter a product or marketing campaign slightly, they’ll stand out. It just doesn’t work that way too often.,
Chances are, the ones who truly stand out took a big chance, and this chance was driven by an understanding of brand differentiation.
There are a few main elements that help differentiation along:,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
#NAME?,,
In order to achieve genuine differentiation, you’ll need some concrete strategies. Here are a few that will drive home the differences you desire:,
1. Thrive to make great stories,,
People overwhelmingly love stories in all mediums. Even popular songs come in the form of stories.,,
Now, brands are finding that a good way to show they’re unique is to tell the tales of how they came to exist. In these stories, they outline the amazing issues they faced and the ways they took it upon themselves to overcome all odds to succeed.
A good brand story also humanizes a brand and makes it easier for customers to connect to it. This in turn produces loyalty that would usually be reserved for other methods.,,
Ultimately, you want the story to reach out and touch the audience in some way, emotionally
2. Focus on a unique market section,,
Sometimes, focusing on a smaller section of the market is something brands choose to do. Other times, it’s out of necessity.
Why is it a necessity? If you’re unable to compete with bigger brands in the current market, switching to a smaller market isn’t really a choice – it’s mandatory to survive.,
Also keep in mind that this change can expand your customer demographics beyond what you originally intended or thought was even possible.,,
The point is, even if you don’t have as many customers, you want a certain few who are advocates and who will remain loyal.
3. Provide exciting experiences,,
When there are two brands with nearly identical products, services and values, the only way for one of them to differentiate from the other is by creating amazing brand experiences.
A common misconception about experiences is that they have to be a groundbreaking ordeal. That’s not the case, as many brand experiences that are memorable tend to be quite subtle and simple.,
Coca-Cola’s ‘Share a Coke’ campaign is a good example of this. Coke didn’t have to hold an extravagant event or launch one of their beverages into space with a rocket to create a memorable experience.,,
Instead, they simply personalized and humanized the idea of buying their product by including different names on bottles so that customers could buy drinks for their friends and family in a personal, thoughtful way.
4. Get creative with your marketing,,
All too often, marketers try to get creative but end up making something that is essentially the same as what competing brands came up with. It may be different, but it elicits the same emotional feel from the audience.
Furthermore, marketing campaigns sometimes go too far in their attempt to differentiate, leaving them with something too extreme or unusual for audiences to enjoy.
The key then is finding a good balance between the same old stuff and the extreme. This requires a combination of research, creativity and good judgment.,
You’ll have to shake up the norms of marketing, but do so in a way that engages audiences and sustains this engagement. Don’t just shock them and expect them to be impressed.,
5. Relay your authority when possible,,
One thing that truly helps a brand stand out among competitors is expertise. Showing a strong authority on subjects makes it easier for a customer to choose your brand.,,
Fortunately, there are a lot of ways to show authority. Remember, of course
PR is an effective method to get the word out that you know what you’re doing. Consider the different outlets you could utilize to show audiences what you’re made of.,,
Another thing that brands often try is guest-blogging. When you find a notable blog, consider writing a piece for them to build your audience and show expertise.,
Chapter 22 – Brand dilution,,
Trying to do too many things at one time gives you firsthand insight into the problem with spreading yourself too thin.,,
Even if done successfully (shaving in the car while driving, homework while watching television, etc.)
When it comes to brands, dilution is a legitimate issue that all too often they’re unprepared for.,
Brand dilution is when a brand attempts to corner a new market or release a product that doesn’t fit what they’ve done in the past. Even if it’s a success financially, it can water down the brand and change its image.,
Brand dilution occurs whenever a company makes a new product that doesn’t fit their expertise or values. Think of it like a mistake that makes someone look inexperienced, or a phrase that makes a person seem uninformed, despite having shown themselves knowledgeable in the past.
The best thing you can do to avoid brand dilution is stick with what you’re good at. If a brand makes great technology gear, it would be strange if they attempted to launch a new food product.,
Here are two contrasting examples, one of a brand who fell victim to dilution, the other of a brand who did it right.
Brands who did it wrong,,
The following brands changed things up for the worse, watering down their brand. Don’t forget that it’s possible for a new product, service or decision to be successful while still diluting the brand.
1. Harley Davidson,,
Harley Davidson has been great at sticking to what they do best, keeping their loyal customers happy and staying true to their values. Unfortunately, this briefly faltered when they attempted to enter the cologne/perfume market.
Harley Davidson Perfume, which came in a rough and tumble type of packaging, was so far off of what the Harley brand is about.
They sell an idea as well as motorcycles, and this idea wasn’t really bolstered at all by perfume.,
2. Michael Jordan,,
Michael Jordan has become a worldwide phenomena, with his logo appearing on just about every piece of basketball gear worn still today.,
However, there was a brief time that he made a costly error to his brand. When he left the sport of basketball, which he dominated at
There was some initial buzz about the decision, but the performance level wasn’t nearly the same as when he was in his true calling – basketball.,
Brands who did it right,,
1. Apple,,
As we see time and time again, the best way to avoid spreading yourself too thin is sticking to what you’re good at. Even if it’s different, it can still be similar.
With Apple, their iPod was similar to what they already did, only different. That’s why it was so successful – Apple used their talents to create something magnificent.
Not only was the iPod a success, but it also built upon Apple’s brand image as a technology juggernaut who was capable of versatility.,
2. Taco Bell,,
Taco Bell has shown they’re willing to mix things up in terms of products and store renovations. To avoid brand dilution, they’ve generally partnered up with other brands to get new products right.,
For example, the Doritos Locos Taco and the Mountain Dew Baja Blast are both huge successes.,
They’ve had successful brand extensions, as well, including the Taco Bell Taco Sauce
Conclusion,,
Your brand is unique in many ways, but no one will really appreciate that fact if you aren’t effectively branding.,
The above concepts provide a solid foundation to the all-important branding processes you’ll engage in. Remember that the more you familiarize with each of these strategies, the more effective your branding efforts will become.,
Lastly," remain focused on branding as much as possible for sustained success.""",
102,https://www.canto.com/blog/branding-process/,"New ideas in the branding process: An exciting guide for 2021
January 1, 2021|
The idea of jumping head first into a task is intriguing, but we all know that in order to get it done right, following a detailed, step-by-step process is best.
Branding is no different, as it requires a willingness to dive right in while having an awareness of important steps to take.
These crucial steps are part of the branding process, and they give brands a chance to create something special while maintaining efficiency.
This guide will walk you through all things branding and give you the main ideas of how to correctly work through a branding process. Let’s get started.
What is branding?
Before outlining the specific steps in the branding process, let’s make sure you have the main ideas of branding first.
Branding is a marketing system that builds a brand using unique elements such as logos, layouts, values, color schemes and more in order to influence customers. Branding gives audiences a way to pick out a specific brand and offers them reasons to choose a brand instead of its competition.
The idea of branding can be exciting, yet sometimes daunting, which is what makes following an effective process so important. Let’s break down the key details of a branding process.
What is the branding process?
The branding process is an overarching attempt to build, boost and maintain a successful brand. Most commonly, it incorporates different stages that must be completed in order. The branding process is usually a path to boost brand awareness and perception.
Though usually thought of as something for newer brands, a branding process concerns all types of brand ages and is an ongoing effort once implemented.
So, how can taking these steps help improve your brand? Let’s go into some of the main ideas.
How the branding process can help you succeed
Before we go further into how the branding process can boost your brand, let’s make sure you know exactly why it’s necessary.
We know that branding has immense benefits and improves all types of projects and marketing campaign success.
The branding process, then, is essentially a guide to reach this success. Its ultimate goal is to boost brands, by balancing research, creativity and understanding.
So how then does the branding process bring you success? Here are some key reasons:
- Delivers insight into specific data and approaches. One of the reasons the branding process builds powerful brands is the strategies and structures it requires. This typically involves important research into different areas.
- Links together different helpful steps. Like with any useful strategy, the ones that work best have steps that sync together toward an ultimate goal. The common steps in a branding process have this synchronicity.
- Encourages innovation and creativity. Certain strategies often take on a rigid approach that overly focuses data but neglects the creative side of things. The branding process ensures this isn’t the case.
Now, before we go into some of the benefits that further show why branding process is important, let’s first dive into the important steps needed to effectively fulfill the process.
Important steps to follow in the branding process
As we’ve noted above, a branding process should involve steps that work in unison with one another, building upon each other. The following unique steps do exactly that.
Discover and understand your brand goals and purpose
Begin the entire process by setting branding goals, values and overall purpose. One thing to consider during this first task is the importance of developing a comprehensive strategy. It goes without saying that this step is going to be your best and only chance to come up with a strategy, at least one that fits with the whole process.
Creating values and setting goals provides you with a path to success, and allows you to look into the future to see what can be accomplished. Push to have a deep understanding of values and goals so that all branding efforts are on point.
A strategy around this stage of the branding process should be a focal point for all involved teams throughout the rest of the process.
Research your competitors and the market, then find your target audience
“Data is the new oil.” – Clive Humby
Next, you’ll need to begin some extensive research and analysis to get a good understanding of the current market. This is something that takes planning as well, and deserves a comprehensive strategy of its own. Furthermore, you’ll need to then determine who will be your target market.
A large part of this market research involves gathering data and specific details about potential competitors.
One of the most important factors here is analyzing the types of things competitors are doing to corner the market.
Evaluating your own goals and values in comparison to the market will make it clear who you should be targeting.
Determine your overall brand qualities and uniqueness
“Normal is not something to aspire to, it’s something to get away from.” – Jodie Foster
Similar to your goal setting is the task of determining brand qualities and uniqueness. A lot of this is based upon the principles of brand positioning.
The reason this step follows our research is because we will want to have a strong understanding of the industry and our potential competitors.
This is because we’re going to use this information to figure out how to exploit our uniqueness. We do this by discovering what makes us stand out in comparison to the competition.
Develop a logo and other visual elements
A logo is one of the most memorable things a brand puts forward to customers. As such, yours should have a positive impact on your target audience’s memory.
There are two things to remember when building the logo:
1. The colors are key
“Color is a power which directly influences the soul.” – Wassily Kandinsky
It’s an observed concept that colors influence strongly the way people feel about something. Some colors indicate relaxation, others provoke a feeling of warning. As such, your logo should use the colors that sync with how your brand makes people feel.
2. Relevancy trumps style
It’s great if you can develop an aesthetically-pleasing logo, but if it doesn’t really fit with your brand goals and values, it won’t have a strong effect on customers. Keep it relevant, even if it’s not stylish.
Once you’ve completed the logo, you can start in on the other visual elements, but remember to keep them in-sync with your logo.
Find your brand voice, tell your story and build a style guide
One of the easiest ways to connect with customers and make your brand memorable is by creating and using a brand voice that thrills and intrigues.
Furthermore, this voice can be used consistently throughout all your future projects, and can be present when telling your brand story. Customers love to read a well-told brand story.
Lastly, creating a brand style guide holds this voice and tone together throughout each new article, project, etc.
Uphold consistency and maintain what you’ve built
“Consistency is found in that work whose whole and detail are suitable to the occasion. It arises from circumstance, custom and nature.” – Vitruvius
The final part of the branding process is striving for brand consistency. Think of the entirety of this process and uphold it consistently throughout each new project.
Finally, maintaining everything you’ve created is the true glue that holds everything together.
In order to do this correctly, schedule periodic checks to make sure all new projects and marketing campaigns adhere to your branding.
Now that you have the steps needed to successfully implement a branding process, let’s take a look at the key benefits of doing so.
3 benefits for those who do it right
The following benefits are reasons why a branding process is so important.
1. Boosts brand perception
An effective branding process positively influences how customers perceive your specific brand, particularly in relation to the market.
This affects pricing decisions, repeat purchases and brand identity. The possibilities are endless with a strong process in place.
The more successful your branding process, the better customers will perceive your brand. Keep this in mind as you’re strategizing different steps of the process.
2. Gives customers a reason to choose you over competitors
It’s not enough to simply go through the motions without a concrete plan and strategy in place when it comes to branding. An effective branding process ensures there is enough reason for a customer to make a purchase.
On top of this, it has become increasingly more clear that customers no longer simply want to make a purchase and be done with a brand. Instead, they’re hoping for a comprehensive brand experience each and every time.
Lastly, the branding process builds an argument as to why the customer should select your brand instead of the competition.
3. Attracts brand loyalty
One of the most intriguing outcomes a brand can achieve with its target audience is to gain followers who stick with them through thick and thin. This level of brand loyalty is extremely valuable and cannot be understated.
A branding process allows brands to build consistency and a strong brand image, which in turn intrigues customers and gains their trust.
A well-executed branding process ensures a brand has given themselves the best chance to gain a cult following.
Begin your own branding process
Prepare your strategies and procedures ahead of time, and you’ll no doubt get the best results from your branding process.
As you move through the steps in the process, think about the ways you can improve in the future. Chances are, you’ll reach your goals and more.

February 2, 2021|
Many sports require the players to wear some type of gear to maximize performance.
When it comes to branding, finding the right branding software is like an athlete wearing gear that perfectly fits.
In this article, I’ll give a basic breakdown of branding software, explain why it’s important, then walk you through a few of the different types available.
At the end of the day, the last thing you want to happen is for your brand to suffer from wearing the wrong type of gear.
What is branding?
Branding is how marketers work to promote a brand using all types of different elements like logos, layouts, color schemes and values. It is ultimately how a brand is able to demonstrate that they’re the correct choice for customers, especially compared to the competition.
“Brand is just a perception, and perception will match reality over time.” – Elon Musk
Effective branding allows for benefits such as stronger brand personas, efficient marketing campaigns, pricing leverages and more.
Naturally, it makes sense to supplement your branding efforts with some type of software system. Let’s break down what this entails, beginning with a quick rundown of branding software itself.
What is branding software?
Branding software is a supplemental tool designed to uphold company-wide branding guidelines. It maintains relevancy by keeping content up to date with the most current images, logos, documents and other branding elements. An effective branding software system ensures each marketing campaign has the correct branding items at all times.
Think of branding software as a way to maximize all branding efforts – a helpful, effective supplemental tool.
It also furthers brand consistency by maintaining standards for each department that utilizes branded materials.
Let’s now dig deeper into why it’s so important to use branding software tools.
The importance of branding software
Similar to the above example, an athlete needs to supplement his or herself with the right gear in order to succeed. Branding is no different.
Committing to something new is easy if you have good reason to do so. What then, are our reasons for implementing a branding software?
Here are some key benefits, but keep in mind that they don’t always apply to each system.
- Automates processes. It can be devastating to a workflow if too much time is spent manually completing tedious tasks. Many systems do it automatically.
- Keeps materials brand-relevant. A marketing campaign with outdated branding materials is the one thing you want to avoid. The right software tool keeps everything on-point.
- Connects team members. Things like live document collaboration are the potential keys to a successful team project.
- Simplifies brand maintenance. The right software system brings everything into focus and ensures that maintaining a brand is easy.
It’s pretty apparent that branding software has many purposes and picking the right one can lead to greater success. Let’s go through the three different options to choose from.
Three dynamic branding software options you need to know about
The following three systems are valuable in their own specific way, offering unique answers to potential problems in the branding process.
1. Digital asset management systems
Digital asset management (DAM) is a branding software solution that fulfills the many needs of enterprises through modern technology.
Here’s a breakdown of what DAM is all about.
What is digital asset management?
Digital asset management is a comprehensive, enterprise-based system that organizes digital assets in a central location for fast and easy retrieval.
Its many features allow users to save time finding branded images throughout projects and campaigns. Things like versioning and advanced user roles keep DAM at the forefront of branding solutions.
Is a DAM system right for you?
As you further your branding journey, the amount of accumulated branded assets is bound to increase. When your specific needs go beyond basic storage, DAM seems to be the right choice.
When you consider that it integrates with marketing tools like WordPress and InDesign (among others) and was created specifically to be a business-based branding solution, it becomes clear that DAM is ideal for users with advanced storage needs.
Some key benefits
So what kind of ways does DAM stand out as a branding software system? Here are a few:
- Powerful metadata management. DAM automates the entire tagging process for images, making it much easier to find any digital file based on numerous keyword searches.
- Advanced security. Because DAM is designed for business-use, it is more advanced in the security department, ensuring sensitive files stay safe.
- Useful integrations. The best DAM systems sync well with your currently-used programs, making it easier to finish projects that require both tools.
- Central storage. One of the most convenient parts of the DAM is the centralized storage, which gives users a place to find important files without searching extensively.
Due to the fact that over 50% of marketing teams have cluttered, inefficient storage, it becomes clear how drastic a DAM could help.
Next, let’s take a look at the type of branding solution you might consider when you need to manage marketing resources.
2. Marketing resource management
Marketing resource management software is designed to improve marketing and branding efforts by making each step in the process more efficient. Let’s go over each aspect of this branding software tool.
What is marketing resource management?
Marketing resource management handles branding and marketing activities through extensive, effective coordination of team members. When you think of the many elements within each marketer’s digital arsenal, it becomes clear that some type of digital automation is important.
Think of resource management as a solution that allows brands to further boost and maximize their marketing campaigns and communication.
Is a marketing resource management system right for you?
First, it should be noted that marketing resource management systems are complex and require advanced administration and/or IT support.
If the name wasn’t evident enough, marketing teams are the biggest benefactors of this type of system. Usually, those who require high amounts of communication benefit most.
The reality is, without a complete system to automate and manage processes surrounding marketing materials, marketers won’t succeed.
Unique benefits
In what way can this type of software system help you? Here are some important benefits:
- Analyzes and measures marketing efficiency. It’s important to get data and insight on how effective a marketing campaign is. Resource management tools automate this process.
- Organizes department teams for campaigns. It’s not always easy to put together the optimal team for certain projects, that’s why this software is so valuable.
- Boosts creativity. Many of the potential restrictions to creative output are diminished with the right software systems, and this is no exception.
3. Cloud file storage solutions
Cloud file storage is a way to organize branded materials without overwhelming physical drive space. As a branding solution, it enhances the organization and storing of relevant items.
Here is a complete rundown of everything this solution has to offer.
What is cloud file storage?
Cloud file storage is an organizational management system that operates remotely, holding large quantities of data and files. It has become the standard for most marketing teams looking to keep files safe without immense storage space requirements.
Because of its distant center, it saves companies precious hard drive space. Cloud file storage digitally sorts information, files and important data, all while being maintained independently by cloud storage companies.
Is a cloud file storage system right for you?
One thing to consider, when discovering potential software tools to implement, is your personal branding needs.
For example, do you end up working with high quantities of branded materials for each new project? Are you swamped with numerous image, audio and video files? If so, the space-saving benefits alone might make a cloud system right for you.
The need for digital storage is definitely growing, but companies aren’t keeping up as of yet. Roughly 85% of business data is unorganized, an unacceptable amount.
In terms of functionality, the ideal system allows for better searching of stored files within its database. This makes for quicker uploading and downloading of branded files for marketing campaigns.
Unique benefits
The following benefits give off the idea of what to expect from this type of solution:
- Enhanced security features. Branded materials hold extra value, and should be held to a higher security standard when stored. The power of cloud systems is they’re on the cutting edge of new security features.
- Increased physical space. As I mentioned above, cloud storage is located remotely, which improves the function of in-house storage (since it has more space to use).
- Bolstered collaboration. Though not specifically suited for collaboration, these systems do offer some potential for it. This is because they often have spaces where users can share files and interact with them live.
Example software system(s) to consider
Not all solutions are created equal, and some will fit your needs better than others. Make sure to do some extensive research on your own. That being said, here are some options.
The most popular cloud file storage system at the moment is Dropbox. It’s an efficient tool that covers a wide range of functions. Some other popular systems include Google Drive and Box, which have their own unique features.
Though Dropbox is the most popular, it doesn’t necessarily fit everyone’s requirements. Make sure to check out some Dropbox alternatives if that’s the case for you.
Ultimately, cloud file storage keeps files safe and saves space, all while upholding brand.
Getting started with branding software
Your key focus should always be about finding the right supplemental tools designed to optimize all your branding efforts.
Once you’ve discovered the system that fits you best, there really is no limit to success.

November 23, 2020|
When they’re just starting out, all brands are basically bare. It’s only with a strategy that they begin to arm themselves with the necessary elements to succeed.
This article will go over the key steps to a comprehensive branding strategy, so you can develop a comprehensive roadmap that fits your business’s needs.
What is branding strategy?
Branding strategy is a unique approach that develops and maintains important brand objectives. It is how a business meets marketing goals, sustains customer relations and solidifies internal promotion. Branding strategy is a comprehensive outline to ensure a brand reaches its goals.
A branding strategy defines how a brand identifies and presents itself to customers and potential customers. Following a clear process as you develop a strategy is key to the success of these efforts.
This guide offers five key steps to an effective strategy. It also will go over five dynamic elements included in strong strategies. Let’s begin.
5 important steps in the branding strategy process
Work through these five steps in order to ensure your strategy works for your brand. Adjust each step to your personal needs when necessary.
1. Determine why your brand is unique
“If you don’t give the market the story to talk about, they’ll define your brand’s story for you.” – David Brier
The first step in any branding strategy is figuring out what makes your specific brand unique. Determine how your different products and services, as well as brand culture, are positioned.
To further demonstrate the power of positioning, let’s use Apple as an example. Apple’s products are of a high quality, always a step ahead of the market mean and their brand culture is transformative. Their specific branding strategy adapts to future changes and reflects its market positioning.
Apple’s brand positioning is an ideal which other brands can aspire to reach. It is a forward-moving brand, willing to take risks in order to set trends and place itself at the forefront of new and exciting technology.
Identify some key elements required to position your own brand. Show why your brand stands out, especially among its competitors. One way to do this is through a USP, or unique selling proposition.
2. Optimize and leverage your USP
A crucial step in the branding strategy is creating and maximizing your USP. A USP, or unique selling proposition, provides reasons why a specific brand is superior to its competitors, showing off its innovative abilities and value.
Once the USP has been created, it’s time to implement it, using it as a foundation all brand assets should follow. The USP is a guiding hand for other brand elements, making it easy to create effective and on-point logos, color schemes and more.
With your USP acting as a reference point, you’ll have branded assets optimized to mesh with your brand ideals. Next, you’ll need to implement these ideas internally.
3. Extend the strategy internally
All too often we believe that branding strategies are limited to advancing a brand to externals, like customers and clients. This of course is only half the battle, and we need to focus on encouraging internal team members to strive for brand greatness.
One of the easiest ways to do this is establishing and distributing a brand style guide. This will boost efficiency and accuracy throughout each project. Another thing you can do is create internal structures, which can pass on relevant information when necessary. This is often done through the use of a brand manager.
Next, you’ll need to consider the outreach of your brand.
4. Keep an ear to the ground
How receptive is your brand to the public? How tuned-in to the customers are you? Ideally, you’ll want to be available on different communicative platforms in order to not leave anyone out.
Structure your strategy around both your current channels of communication, as well as platforms you plan to use in the future. It may help to take an inventory of the platforms your brand reaches out on. This prevents incidents where customers feel you’re unresponsive as a brand.
Using these numerous channels, take advantage of the opportunity to present the highlights of your brand to the public. Usually, this takes offering them something of value. After this is done, it’s time to evaluate the functionality of your strategy.
5. Embrace analytics
Now that you have a branding strategy in place, it’s time to check whether or not it’s meeting your standards. The best way to do this is by measuring it throughout the implementation process. Nearly everything is quantifiable in marketing – don’t be led to believe otherwise.
Potential metrics include web traffic on certain pages, email engagement and how often social media content is shared.
There are fortunately many tools to check how well your branding strategy is working, such as Google Analytics. Use all the weapons you have at your disposal to ensure your branding strategy is working well.
Now that you have some ways to better create a branding strategy, let’s look at the crucial components of a strategy.
5 qualities of a successful branding strategy
The following five elements, though they aren’t the only ones, are some of the most fundamental qualities of a powerful branding strategy.
1. Brand-wide uniformity
No branding strategy can hold up without a concerted effort for uniformity across different channels and marketing campaigns. There should be an obvious connection from one platform or advertisement to the next, ensuring customers don’t get conflicting ideas about your brand or become confused with the messaging.
For example, say that your brand has blue color schemes and lighthearted messaging. If you had a blue layout and goofy phrases on the business YouTube page, but red layouts and serious tone on the Facebook page, the transition from one to the next won’t be seamless. Keep brand consistency in mind when creating branding strategies.
2. Adaptability
Though we need to maintain uniformity throughout our marketing campaigns, that doesn’t mean we have to close our brand off from adjustment and adaptability. Instead, part of our branding strategy should include occasional adjustments.
Does this mean a total rebranding effort should take place regularly? Of course not, but the concept should be at least a part of your branding strategy so that you can make the correct adjustments when needed.
3. True focus on customers
The customer perspective should be at the center of all your branding activities. This includes finding the right market, as well as keeping current customers happy through different creative efforts.
It’s one thing to find and attract the right customers to your products and services. It’s another to then put serious focus into retaining them. Show them that you care about them, and that they’re more than just numbers in a machine.
4. Adherence to statistics and data
Without a legitimate focus on stats and data, you’ll be behind in many different ways. It’s not enough to just be aware of relevant information. Instead, you need to interpret these numbers and consider how they relate to your strategic goals.
One of the biggest advantages to focusing on the available data is the idea that you’ll be able to better understand your competitors, which will in turn provide opportunities to outperform them. Consider how trends and the analysis of these trends could give you an edge.
5. Communication
Finally, an important element in an effective branding strategy is a commitment to communication throughout the brand. Remember that all parts of a brand need to communicate in a similar way to retain customer loyalty.
Make sure that your strategy pushes employees to communicate with each other and customers in a way that suits the brand ideals. You’ll find that once everyone is on the same page, all other areas of the strategy you create will work much better.
Final thoughts
I encourage you to pick and choose the techniques and elements from this guide that specifically speak to your strategic goals. No article can lead you to the exact strategy you want to build. Fill in the pieces along the way so that your brand is bolstered by a personalized strategy.

Branding is an important process that isn’t solved or finished overnight – don’t undergo it alone!
There are many different resources available to guide your branding, so make sure to take advantage.
If you’re uncertain which resources are best, this guide is for you. I’ll walk you through the basics, then show you seven branding websites that are sure to help along the way. Let’s begin.
What is branding?
Branding is a way to build a brand up using numerous elements such as values, color schemes and logos, which are used to influence customers. It is a marketing process that gives audiences a chance to differentiate between brands and help them make an informed choice.
Without branding, it’s hard to show potential customers that you’re the solution to their problems instead of the competition.
Unfortunately, approximately only 25% of customers feel most brands truly understand them individually.
Branding breathes life and uniqueness into a company that wouldn’t otherwise be able to exist. Let’s dive into some other reasons why it’s so important.
Importance of branding
“A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another.” – Seth Godin
As we referenced above, branding provides potential customers with reasons to choose you over the competition, highlighting significant, meaningful differences.
In return for powerful branding, companies are rewarded with more successful campaigns, brand loyalty and more.
Here are some key ways branding drives success:
- Encourages customer spending. Branding is a way to guide a customer to your product, no matter the price. It’s been proven that people purchase from a specific brand for similar quality even at a higher price.
- Fuels brand personas. One of the ideas behind branding is to create and maintain a powerful brand persona which brings a brand to life with human emotions and character.
- Boosts employee cooperation. Part of the importance branding delivers comes in the form of internal involvement, which boosts team cooperation and attracts new and better job applicants. With good branding, employees have a chance to feel a part of something greater.
- Improves marketing campaigns. An underrated aspect of branding is the leverage it creates for marketers, boosting their future campaigns and projects. If branding is effective, new marketing campaigns will be as well.
It’s pretty clear that branding has a big impact. Accordingly, let’s make sure you have the best resources available to guide you.

3 example websites that demonstrate elite branding
The Following three examples will give you a chance to see what types of things work and how successful brands approach branding.
1. Apple
Apple serves as a great example because of how well they incorporate branding into many different areas on their website. They provide a simple user experience that expresses to visitors exactly the type of company they have found – a unique, modern business that adheres to the whims of tech.
Apple’s homepage meets customer concerns about security, quality, safety and tech functionality. They accomplish this by showcasing beautiful images and detailed product descriptions.
One way that Apple separates itself from others is their total commitment to branding whenever possible. For example, instead of simply re-decorating their website for a holiday, they will incorporate the festivities into their brand.
This seems like a minor strategy, but these types of branding efforts influence customer outlook and allow customers to feel like Apple is moving through the stages of life alongside them.
How to apply the principles of this example: Mostly, when considering the success of Apple’s branding, think about their synchronicity with what they want to represent. Everything they do in terms of visuals, tone, messaging and more align with how they want customers to feel about them. When you’ve found your own ideals and values, take this same approach.
2. Seriously Unsweetened
When a user visits Seriously Unsweetened’s website, they notice the simplicity first and foremost. The menu is small, simple and out of the way.
All necessary functions are in the menu, and there’s little to no extra unnecessary features. Some brands choose to load their site with excessive details and images, but Seriously did the opposite. Customers get the feeling that the site was branded in a way that fits with simple, smooth soft drinks.
The reason this example stands out is the branding makes the customer feel that Seriously’s website is representative of their beverages. In fact, the website design, layout and color usage mimic the actual drink being sold.
Users exploring the site feel refreshed as they browse each page, just as they would if they were drinking the product. Each picture is even designed to bubble and fizz as you scroll. Lastly, the simplicity and lack of excess matches the drinks they sell, creating the perfect brand image and influencing the customer.
How to apply the principles of this example: At some point, everyone, no matter who they are, becomes overwhelmed with the extras. Seriously Unsweetened decided to keep things low key and prevent anyone from feeling overwhelmed by their branding materials. This made it easier for customers to focus on their products. Use simplicity whenever possible in your own processes.
3. Adidas
The Adidas website provides customers with everything they want from a sports company, both in product display and the overall feeling of the site. The homepage gives visitors a chance to view and purchase the product, however, this is only a portion of why the website’s branding is successful.
When a customer visits the Adidas site, they want to feel a certain way: motivated, energized and invigorated. The website is therefore jumping (no pun intended) with exercise images and videos. This type of branding syncs perfectly with customer emotions.
The layout of the website can definitely be overwhelming upon first glance, but it’s not cluttered or disorganized. Instead, there is an extensive menu which helps users locate whatever they’re searching for.
Adidas’ branding reaches customers and lets them know that Adidas connects with them and understands their goal. Its fast-paced layout lures the motivated people into the Adidas culture.
How to apply the principles of this example: Adidas digs into the emotions, drive and desire of customers better than most brands out there. Their branding encourages the right types of people to feel inspired. When working through your branding, look to touch on the key principles you want to connect with.
Final ideas
Branding is far too important of a process to navigate without serious research and outside help. Don’t neglect the many branding websites designed to get you through the necessary tasks.
Also, become aware of the many ways that successful brands go about their branding – you’d be surprised how much you can learn simply by paying closer attention.

December 2, 2021|
Today’s workplace is increasingly defined by hybrid environments that allow organizations to draw upon talent far beyond their local market. Employees are often incorporated into distributed teams that include members from many different physical locations. In many cases, these teams even cross state and national boundaries to create a truly diverse collection of talent dedicated to a common goal.
Distributed teams are made possible by innovations in technology that allow their members to share resources and collaborate without having to be in the same physical location. While there are many collaboration tools available, matching the right software to the group’s needs can mean the difference between long-term productivity and disruptive frustration.
Unique challenges of distributed teams
Whether a distributed team is part of a hybrid workforce or completely virtual, they face several unique challenges compared to in-person teams when it comes to working collaboratively. Communication, for instance, needs to be much more thorough and deliberate. Instructions and expectations cannot be left vague because it might not be possible to get more detail quickly, especially if team members are separated by time zones. While hybrid and virtual teams often have many communications channels available (such as email, messaging applications, or task management software), everyone may not use them the same way, making it easy to miss important details.
As a result of communication challenges, many remote employees end up working in isolation rather than spending collaborating with fellow team members. While this may seem like a good solution from an individual standpoint, it prevents teams from reaching their full potential because a lot of work ends up being done (or redone) more than once. Even if redundancies are kept to a minimum, the final deliverable often ends up feeling like something that was cobbled together from several disparate sources rather than standing as a singular, coherent project.
Four common productivity challenges with collaboration tools
Although distributed teams allow organizations to leverage talent from around the world, bringing those people together in a productive virtual environment can be difficult without the right software tools in place. These tools should help teams overcome the common problems associated with hybrid and remote work. Unfortunately, organizations sometimes try to get by with using applications for tasks and processes they’re not really designed to handle. This ends up leading to wasted time and frustration as employees continually try to force a square peg into a round hole.
Here are four challenges that are often made worse by having the wrong collaboration tools in place:
1. Confusion
Productivity and efficiency are heavily dependent upon employees knowing what to do and how to access the resources they need to carry out their responsibilities. When software tools make it difficult to locate those resources, people end up spending valuable time searching for what they need rather than doing productive work. Anyone who has spent hours (or even longer) sifting through various Google Drive or Sharepoint folders in search of a digital asset they need knows just how much of an impact confusion can have on efficient collaboration.
2. Workflow disruption
Good collaboration tools make it easy for employees to manage tasks within a single workflow, which reduces the amount of time spent shifting resources between applications. As more people become involved in a task, preserving a streamlined workflow becomes even more important. When team members have to constantly move assets between applications and pull them from various storage locations, there’s a greater chance of something going wrong, whether it’s a file being misplaced or a key task being overlooked and uncompleted. In addition to creating more confusion, workflow disruption also makes it difficult to maintain a single source of truth for assets.
3. Version control
One of the greatest challenges with collaboration has always been version control. When multiple people are working on a single project, it’s vital that everyone knows which version of an asset is the most up to date. While cloud applications have made this somewhat easier by mostly eliminating local file storage, they can actually make the problem worse if it’s hard to manage or work with assets within the platform. This encourages people to create their own workarounds and processes, such as making copies of files and sharing them over separate different platforms.
4. Security
In addition to undermining productivity, poor collaboration tools also create a host of security risks. When software tools make it difficult to complete routine tasks, most people respond by developing their own system of doing things. Unfortunately, removing assets and work processes from an application exposes them to an open and potentially compromised environment. If someone were to download a copy of an asset to a device that’s been infected with malware, that file could easily serve as a vector for a costly security breach the moment it’s uploaded again or sent to another team member.
Strengthening productivity with DAM software
Distributed teams that work heavily with digital media assets, such as high-resolution images, audio files, and video, can avoid these productivity challenges by implementing a digital asset management (DAM) solution that’s designed for their specific workflow and collaboration needs. Unlike most asset management systems, DAM software was created with visual assets in mind so that collaborative teams can locate and access the resources they need quickly and seamlessly integrate them into a workflow.
With Canto’s DAM solution, for example, organizations can set up dedicated portals for sharing assets among distributed teams and various stakeholders. Powerful organization features make it easy to search for content, while extensive integrations eliminate the cumbersome process of transferring files from one application to another. Since assets remain stored in the Canto platform, it’s much easier to maintain strict version controls and keep sensitive data secure.

October 30, 2019|
How can organizations transition their decades-old asset libraries into the digital age? Many organizations accumulate assets over time, including assets from before the digital age. A big challenge for these organizations is making these physical assets accessible and searchable. A digital asset management (DAM) solution can help solve these frustrations, even for organizations with a physical archive!
Don’t believe us? Jess Scott, archivist/marketing specialist at Bruce Lee Enterprises, talked to us about how she uses Canto to organize both their digital and physical archives.
Organizing assets
Canto makes it easy for Jess to keep tens of thousands of photos in the archives organized and easy to retrieve.
Library architecture
Jess set up the library structure in Canto to make assets easy to find. She created folders organized by subject matter and usage, such as stills from films and TV, photos of martial arts practice and portraits and family.
Then, she organized the physical archives in the same way. Jess also tags digital photos with the cabinet and shelf where the physical photos live, so that team members can find both the digital and physical copies of an asset by checking in Canto.
Duplicate check
Many organizations need to delete duplicate assets that take up storage space, but keep all of their unique assets. Bruce Lee Enterprises has many very similar photos, so Canto’s duplicate check identifies true duplicates that can be discarded and prevents them from accidentally deleting similar, but unique, images.
Finding and using assets
Having a vast archive is valuable, but only if team members can find and use assets. Canto’s search and filter tools and metadata help teams find what they’re looking for quickly.
Bruce Lee Enterprises kicked off a social media series, ‘From the Archives,’ using their assets in Canto. Jess writes the social copy for their social media manager in the description of the images they use and tags each image with ‘From the Archives.’ This helps the team find the asset later on via search, and also keeps track of which images they have already shared on social.
Recently, the organization had an opportunity to participate in a Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) exhibit on influential fashion items and needed to recreate Bruce Lee’s jogging suit. They were able to quickly find all images in their archive of his jogging suit from multiple angles, and even a page from his journal, where he recorded the date of the shoot when he wore it!
Simple sharing
Jess loves using Canto collection links to share assets outside of the organization, because they provide granular control and an easy user experience.
“With the collection link, you can ‘micromanage’ how people access your photos. You know who you’re sharing it to and for how long,” says Jess. “People know what a link is. It’s a language they already speak.”"

“Organizing stuff is fun!” Said no marketer ever.
Well, maybe a few OCD folks out there have proclaimed their affection for keeping everything in their lives organized. But for the most part, setting up a system of order isn’t exactly why creative, analytical and communication-savvy people join the ranks of marketing professionals.
Marketers want to communicate
We want to influence. We want to test hypotheses and track results. And we also want to move fast. We must. But in order to do all of that, we have to keep things organized.
Don’t believe me? Allow me to share a little analogy from the real world to illustrate the point.
Imagine, for a moment, that over time your co-workers let your snack counter turn into a giant jumbled mess resembling a leftover discard pile.
Now, it looks like there are some good treats in there. The real healthy, organic hipster kinds that aren’t cheap.
But how can you find the one you want? How do you even know what’s available?
You can’t. You don’t.
You need order and organization to see your options before making a good selection.
This couldn’t be more true when it comes to backend marketing assets as well!
If you keep your photos, video clips, logos and other digital assets spread across people’s computers, file share sites and in a hodge-podge of digital places – then it will be very hard to select the best image for your upcoming newsletter, blog article or social media post.
You need to organize your stuff to make it quick and easy to make the right choices
You need to be able to see everything in one place.
You need your content categorized. You need like things with like things. When your snacks are in order, you can pick what you really want and not just settle for something that’s easy to grab at the top of the pile.
Similarly, when your digital assets are labeled well (tags, keywords, metadata) and in order, you can narrow in on the perfect product shot, you can be sure to grab the right version of a photo and you can feel confident that you’ve made a great choice.
A centralized digital asset management system makes it possible for marketers to organize, find and share all their best content with ease.
The moral of this short story is, don’t be like this guy:

May 17, 2022|
What do Snoop Dogg, Nike, Sotheby’s, and PwC all have in common? They’ve all invested in real estate in the metaverse.
Looking beyond the world we see in two dimensions on screens—phones, laptops, desktops, or iPads—they have decided to purchase a plot of pixels in a three-dimensional virtual world we can experience through a headset.
These are just a few of the entrepreneurs and brands experimenting with new forms of audience engagement. So, what can we learn about brand building in the metaverse from these pioneers?
There is a multiverse of virtual environments
While the word “metaverse” sounds like one place where everyone’s digital avatar is hanging out, the reality is a multiverse: A series of different 3D worlds on different platforms. These platforms are typically world-building games.
You’ll find Snoop in The Sandbox, where you can “attend Snoop’s private metaverse parties, get access to exclusive NFTs, and enjoy priceless experiences.” More about non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in a moment—in the metaverse, nothing is going to be free.
Let’s leave The Sandbox and join Roblox, where you can try out the virtual skatepark built by a company synonymous with skateboarding, the California footwear brand Vans, or join the nine million-plus virtual athletes who enjoy the sports challenges in Nike Land.
Head over to Decentraland and you can find Sotheby’s auction house and a virtual version of Samsung’s New York store. The Samsung store was launched to coincide with CES 2022. Visitors can start a quest “exploring, playing, and collecting” digital assets.
If you join the 350 million gamers who play Fortnite, you will encounter brands galore—from Marvel to Wendy’s. Then, of course, there’s Facebook—sorry—Meta’s own Horizon platform and Horizon Workrooms for workplace collaboration.
In short, the metaverse is not just a revival of the early iteration of a virtual world, Second Life, which saw brands populate “islands” in the same environment. Today, brands are deciding where they want to be in the metaverse—or, like AMC’s Walking Dead TV series, choosing to exist in different forms in a number of these virtual worlds at the same time.
What’s striking is that the early winners in the metaverse are the brands that speak to an authentic identity—with a twist that’s relevant in these new environments.
E-commerce is turning into I-commerce
Some of the most successful brands and entrepreneurs have moved beyond e-commerce into i-commerce, or immersive commerce—transactions based on users’ deeper interactions in this new digital environment.
Take the example of The Gucci Garden exhibition in Roblox for two weeks in May 2021. The Gucci Gardens took the form of different rooms. Upon entering them, visitors’ avatars became neutral mannequins—effectively blank canvases—absorbing different elements of the exhibition as they passed through.
“With every person experiencing the rooms in a different order and retaining different fragments of the spaces, they will emerge at the end of their journey as one-of-a-kind creations, reflecting the idea of individuals as one among many, yet wholly unique,” Roblox said when announcing the Gucci Garden.
Visitors could then buy virtual Gucci products to dress or accessorize their avatars. Such was the demand for Gucci products that a bee-embroidered digital bag that was initially sold for 475 Robux (about $6) was resold for 350,000 Robux (about $4,115). That’s about $800 more than the bag costs in the real world. Was it popular? Ask the 19.9 million visitors who made a virtual trip.
Sotheby’s virtual re-creation of its London auction rooms (with the exception of the yellow ape that greets you at the door) gives a stamp of authority to the trading of NFTs—the one-of-a-kind digital assets that are being traded in the metaverse.
These unique assets range from video or audio clips to memes to Jack Dorsey’s first tweet, which sold for just under $3 million.
According to Max Moore, head of contemporary art auctions at Sotheby’s Asia, “We realized we could play a very important role in this burgeoning market, given our current role in the contemporary art market and the physical collectibles world, where we bridge the gap between the two worlds.”
What’s clear is whether it is Vans’ skatepark, the Gucci Garden, or a Sotheby’s NFT auction, pioneer brands that are chalking up early success in the metaverse are doing so by creating an immersive virtual experience that says something about who or what they are—not an alternative brand to their physical reality.
They are having fun with their brand, for sure. There is a playfulness that fits the platform. But the core values and identity that we would find in the brand in the physical world is retained—just with added yellow apes.
Test and learn, but stay faithful to your brand
Marketing has always looked to test innovative platforms, going back to the first digital ad run by AT&T in 1994 (“Have you ever clicked your mouse right here? You will.”).
That’s because meeting people where they are is a core tactic that remains true, even if where people are today is a virtual world rather than a physical one.
Whether the metaverse is the future of human interaction in digital environments remains to be seen. For now, brands must explore it. But, in doing so, there’s another truth to hold on to: Brand integrity and managing consistency always matter, regardless of the platform.

February 18, 2022|
If your organization has been trying to manage a growing collection of digital assets across multiple platforms and storage locations, you’ve already seen just how challenging and inefficient that task can become. Simply locating a file can be a challenge without any system in place to assign searchable tags or metadata, and even when you do find the file you need, there’s often no easy way to determine whether it’s the most up-to-date version. What’s worse, you may also be managing access for multiple collaborators and trying to control what assets employees share on their social media channels.
In other words, it’s a big mess.
Fortunately, there’s a solution designed specifically for this unique problem. Digital asset management software centralizes your assets into a single source of truth that makes it easy to locate and control your branded content. If you have the authority to adopt a new platform and process, the choice is an easy one. If not, however, you may find yourself in the position of having to build a persuasive digital asset management business case for your company.
Making a business case for digital asset management
The decision to add a new software platform to an organization’s tech stack isn’t always made by the people who will be using it. While the benefits of a digital asset management solution may be obvious to anybody involved in the day-to-day production of content, they’re probably less so to someone in another department or function. This is particularly true in a large enterprise environment, where decision makers may be far removed from the production process and evaluating potential software purchases on a variety of factors.
Some of these considerations likely include questions like:
- How will we measure the ROI of the new software?
- Will the software disrupt existing workflows across multiple departments?
- Can the organization’s existing software do the job just as well?
- Will the new software create security problems?
Making a business case for why digital asset management can benefit an organization is often the fastest way to address these concerns and win over decision makers. By focusing less on how the software works and more on how it will actually impact the business, you can make a persuasive case for implementing a new software solution.
5 key points to highlight in your digital asset management business case
The first step to building a compelling business case is gathering data. Talk to the people who work with your digital assets on a regular basis to identify pain points. You should also review your existing processes to determine where improvements need to be made. If mistakes have occurred due to poor asset management practices, be sure to determine where things went wrong and how the problem could have been prevented.
After gathering your research, you can use it to make several important points about how you’re doing things now and how a digital asset management platform could improve the business.
1. Content demands are growing
Organizations are sharing content over more channels than ever before. Whether it’s your company website, email campaigns, social media accounts, or advertising, your digital brand assets are being deployed in many different places at once. This trend will only accelerate in the future, so it’s critical to have a system in place to manage these content demands. By providing information about where and how your organization is using digital assets, you can emphasize the growing need for a solution that makes them easier to manage and deploy.
2. Wasted time is wasted money
Time wasted searching for missing assets or recreating lost content can be quantified in ways that show just how much having inefficient processes and systems in place is costing your organization. A Canto study found that about a third (33.4 percent) of people working in marketing spend the equivalent of three weeks per year searching for digital assets, while 15 percent of them spend as much as six weeks trying to locate content spread across multiple servers and cloud storage platforms.
If an employee making $25 an hour is spending roughly 11.5 hours a week searching for the right asset, that comes out to nearly $15,000 in lost productivity. Organizing all assets into a single, easy-to-manage source of truth could easily eliminate much of that waste and vastly improve efficiency.
3. Brand management is critical
In the fast-moving digital age, organizations understand the importance of investing in their brand as a way to build trust with customers. Brand management is an essential part of building and maintaining that reputation over time while also adapting to new market conditions and consumer expectations. Without a system in place to ensure everyone is adhering to branding guidelines, the brand can quickly become inconsistent in terms of visuals and tone. Implementing approval workflows, organizing approved assets in a centralized location, and establishing version control to eliminate outdated content are all vital steps that need to be taken to ensure successful brand management.
4. Better data leads to better decisions
Sometimes, the most persuasive data in a business case is the absence of data. Organizations dedicate extensive resources to creating brand assets in the expectation that they will help generate better awareness and loyalty among customers. But if they don’t know how those assets are being utilized, it’s difficult to make decisions about what sort of content is most effective in terms of messaging. Consolidating digital brand assets into a centralized platform makes it easier to accurately track how assets are being used (and by whom). The data obtained from this reporting can inform future strategy and creative direction.
5. Improved control enhances security
Managing user access across multiple platforms is challenging at best and frequently results in confusion or outright mistakes. Someone may be granted access to confidential files by accident, or credentials may not be withdrawn even after a user no longer needs them. The problem becomes even worse when dealing with people outside your organization. By placing files in a secure digital asset management platform with extensive sharing features, you can easily distribute content without creating additional security risks. Upload links, customizable web portals, and time-sensitive access permissions provide ways to share content that are much more secure than trying to manage access across several systems.

April 20, 2020|
Finding the right balance between different business teams is a lot easier than you think. In fact, a few minor adjustments to your process will result in immensely positive changes.
Innovative changes to your current business collaboration approach give your teams a chance at huge growth and success. Creating team success is easy if you understand communication dynamics. Luckily, this important concept is simple to learn. Here are three business collaboration ideas to get your teamwork moving.
Strategize for connectivity
The first thing you’ll want to do is sync up different departments in order to improve overall team communication. For example, if the IT members are sitting in the same room as marketers, there’s bound to be some disconnect. However, this is an opportunity to create interdepartmental communication and get the creative juices flowing. This is one of the most basic changes that has profound positive impact on team connectivity throughout campaigns.
Whenever you have an interdepartmental meeting, map out the departments of different team members. Next, plan ahead, taking into account the potential number of team members from multiple divisions. This planning will help you capitalize on project collaboration opportunities. Interdepartmental collaborative mapping promotes better overall problem-solving within the company. Lay out extensive, accessible plans to broaden lines of communication. As a result, more creative avenues are explored and team projects improve.
Use cloud technology
With all the powerful technology available today, there’s no reason to tackle these important tasks alone. Instead, supercharge your team’s collaboration efforts with cutting-edge cloud technology. Cloud collaboration programs give more access and connective properties to a team. Business collaboration solutions also give employees a variety of functionality to keep lines of communication open. This encourages creative collaboration in projects and campaigns, which leads to more effective advertisements.
Cloud collaboration tools open a lot of lines of communication for a team. Consider using digital asset management (DAM) to organize your creative assets like images, videos and documents. It allows members of the team to share files and integrate important applications. A cloud DAM like Canto is an advanced solution that boosts creative projects and saves time. Most importantly, it furthers communication while keeping all sensitive documents secure.
Reconfigure creative teams
Remember that your team makeup isn’t set in stone. Feel free to go through plenty of different trial and error until everyone feels comfortable and projects are going smoothly. One way to accomplish this is by utilizing different skills and creative talents of each team member. This is sure to boost project efficacy over time. Another important thing to do is create a system that encourages every individual to use their visionary prowess. That way, the strongest traits of each team member is pronounced within the team, creating a strong grouping.
On top of promoting existing creative strengths within individuals, collaboration reconfiguration further develops these traits and characteristics. Employees grow their skills while working with others – especially when they mesh with these team members. This ultimately leads to proficient team project schemes.
Business collaboration continues to evolve with technological innovations and modern work spaces. Make sure you stay ahead of the curve."

A growing number of marketing teams are using Canto digital asset management to easily centralize, organize, and share their digital assets. This Canto Customer Spotlight provides three real-world examples of how leading marketing teams are using Canto Portals.
One of the ways Canto helps marketing teams share digital assets is by allowing them to create custom branded portals. These web portals can be public or password protected and can easily be curated and permissioned so that only approved files can be accessed by the appropriate audiences. This enables convenient self-service that not only makes it much easier and faster for the user to access the digital assets they need, increasing their satisfaction with marketing, but it also dramatically reduces the time-consuming hassle and resource draining burden on the marketing team.
Wheel Pros
“The purpose of this Portal is to help our Sales team and customer partners go to one place to get all of the assets they need to create marketing campaigns. Previously, people need to reach out to me and I need to guess what pics and assets they want to use…which as you can imagine, turns into a ton of emails back and forth trying to get the correct results. With Portals, they can dive in and find exactly what they want, quickly and efficiently.”
– Robert Todd, Marketing
Bumkins
“We use our public Portal to provide imagery to our licensees, consumers, and retailers. Canto allows us to keep everything nice and organized and makes it easy to search through our large library of product, model, and lifestyle images. It’s been an absolute game changer.”
– Leyna Segal, Photographer
Sagitec
“Our Portal is to distribute marketing assets to employees throughout the company and 3rd-party vendors. Assets include branding elements, collateral, and proposal graphics. Will continue adding to the Portal with additional assets such as branded templates, graphics, videos, and more. I love using Canto and so do many of my coworkers; can’t wait to get everyone in the company using it!”

September 5, 2019|
We love getting to know the creative and inspiring people who use Canto, and we figured it was only fair that our customers get to know each other as well!
Last week, we hosted our first Meet & Learn in San Francisco – an intimate event where SF-based customers could network with each other, meet our team face-to-face and get the inside scoop about the latest Canto feature releases over drinks and tacos.
From consumer goods to enterprise B2B to nonprofit, we had the pleasure of hosting customers from industries all across the board. Each organization is changing the world in a different way, whether it’s Tandem providing books to underprivileged children or Redbubble helping artists share their work with wider audiences, and we’re happy to be a part of that.
One of the highlights of the evening was when Ilya, Canto’s head of implementation, gave a sneak peek of our newest time-saving features, including:
-
- My Selections: Canto customers were thrilled to get a sneak peek of My Selections before the feature launched! This highly anticipated feature allows users to temporarily save items to a clipboard that refreshes after each session. Users can now simultaneously select and share assets located in multiple albums, something that previously required multiple extra steps – saving precious time. In the words of Bonnie (Tandem, Partners in Early Learning), “It’s like a Vegas thing: what happens during your Canto session stays there” – and after you log out, your selections are cleared.
- Duplicate checks: Customers can now perform a duplicate check of the entire library at any time. Previously, users could only perform duplicate checks when uploading new assets.
- Portal Watermarks: Users can apply Watermarks directly to assets in a Portal, instead of applying Watermarks in the main library first and then syncing.
Customers also shared their favorite Canto features and their feature wishlist. We’re excited to see our Google Chrome plug-in and Style Guide features being used. We also love to hear about the features our customers wish Canto had, so we can continuously update the platform to help our customers’ work flow even more seamlessly.
Kelsey from Tandem shared her excitement for Canto’s Style Guides, saying that Tandem’s operations manager – who had previously created a 23-page style guide – was absolutely thrilled to use this one stop shop within Canto.
“Everyone knows what to do and what logos to use. Canto’s Style Guides are so accessible,” said Kelsey.
Thank you to everyone who came to our first Meet and Learn. We’re busy planning more of these events around the country and can’t wait to bring more of our customers together!"

November 3, 2021|
Portals are Canto’s all-purpose solution for sharing assets at scale. With flexible configuration options and customizable branding, they adapt to fit a whole host of business needs.
Want to share assets externally? You can open Portals up to anyone – whether they’re a Canto user or not. Need to deliver content in something more polished than a Dropbox link? Portals have you covered, with colors and backgrounds that fit the look and feel of your brand. Every business is different, and so is every Portal.
So how do Portals help companies succeed? To offer some inspiration, we’ve rounded up a few popular ways brands use Canto Portals to get more out of their digital assets.
1. Win customers over with curated content collections
“Creating Portals as a selling tool has changed the nature of our business,” says Natasha Ward, information manager at Bantam Materials, the company behind Prevented Ocean Plastic.
Bantam converts plastic bottle waste into RPET flakes, a material used for sustainable plastic packaging. To strengthen existing relationships and win new customers, they create bespoke Portal sales kits with relevant images and videos for each packaging manufacturer. Bantam’s Portals also include regulatory and logistics information tailored to each customer – all crucial for making the sale.
“Canto Portals are the added sweetener on top,” says Natasha. “The idea of sharing digital media this way impresses and excites everyone. It’s the final piece of the puzzle for customers that nobody else in the market offers. They are always impressed by it.”
2. Empower sales teams to react on the fly
Portals aren’t just for external sharing – they’re also a convenient way to distribute content collections to other teams in your company. Because Portals are curated and easy to navigate, they allow sales teams to find images, video and other content at the speed of business. If an unexpected request comes up in the middle of a sales call, no problem – sales reps can find and share persuasive images while the customer is still on the phone.
“Project photos are often critical to making the sale,” explains Krista Short, marketing director at modular construction company Falcon Structures. Prior to using Canto, finding the right image was such a hassle at Falcon, it was starting to interfere with the sales process. Now, the most compelling photos of past projects are at sales reps’ fingertips. “We make sure that everything the sales team needs is in the Portal,” says Krista. “It works really well for us.”
3. Help retailers promote your brand and products
Consumer brands rely on retailers to highlight their products in marketing materials and in stores. Of course, so do their competitors. So how can brands stand out from the crowd and ensure their products are the ones that end up in the spotlight? Canto Portals provide retailers with an easy, reliable source of product images – making them the first place they’ll go to grab what they need.
“An REI-type store might carry 20 of our products and need imagery to put up on their website,” explains Jeff Williamson, creative producer at the iconic boot brand Danner. “Instead of photographing the boots themselves, they’ll just pull it from our library.”
4. Give external partners access to everything they need – and nothing they don’t
External partners, like agencies and consultants, offer welcome support – but you don’t always want to give them access to your whole library. Portals offer a convenient way to wall off parts of your content collection. That way, external collaborators have space to explore and find great content themselves – without having to email back and forth every time they need an image or design file.
“Anyone can go into the Portal to find what they need,” says Brandon Perry, co-founder and CMO of Island Brands USA. Now, content produced by Island Brands’ external partners always matches the look and feel the brand wants to project. “There’s brand integrity in this,” explains Chris Edington, the company’s creative director. “Anybody who interacts with our brand from the moment they get this link is always going to have the correct logo and approved photography.”
5. Create press kits journalists will love
Journalists’ days are dictated by tight deadlines. Too much back and forth over images and how to credit them can easily turn a PR win into a missed opportunity. With Canto Portals, PR teams can easily assemble and update press kits, so journalists have the right images – and all the information that goes with them – on hand.
For amsterdam&partners, the team responsible for promoting the city of Amsterdam, creating press kits in Canto has made delivering pre-approved visuals to journalists a breeze. “In the Portal, we can align everything with our logo and our style guides,” explains web editor Pauline Arkesteijn. “It’s really nice to share this with journalists – it looks amazing, and we can easily share a wide range of content.”
Stand out from the crowd with your own Canto Portal
Whether hundreds of retail partners or a handful or freelancers, Canto Portals offer a simple way to share large collections of digital assets with any audience. After all, it’s not just the digital assets that represent your brand – the package you deliver them in matters too.

Last month, Canto took to the pavement to raise money for Oasis for Girls, a San Francisco non-profit that helps girls from under-resourced communities develop skills to create strong futures.
To raise money for Oasis for Girls’ after-school programs, the Canto team decided to host a 5k running event called Run for the Queens.
“We wanted to do a fun activity for the company and thought a 5k would be a great and COVID-friendly idea!” says Alisha Chakravarty, a senior account manager at Canto who helped organize the event.
On Sunday, April 25th, groups of runners across five states participated in the event. Even a few furry friends also joined the fun!
Through generous donations from our Canto runners and team members, we were able to raise over $4,000 for Oasis for Girls. Thank you to everyone who participated!
Canto Cares is an employee resource group committed to volunteering their time and creating a stronger team culture. The group regularly holds conversations around social justice and is finding ways to give back to the community. They’ve held several fundraisers and volunteering events with local San Francisco organizations, including Raphael House, Saint Anthony’s and City of Dreams.

January 12, 2022|
Sales enablement is a major focus for many marketing teams – and with good reason. Sales reps armed with compelling collateral have the tools they need to win customers over. But without the right systems in place to deliver that content, disorganized collections of collateral can slow sales teams down. Salespeople get bogged down sifting through folders, or lose track of what sales tools they have at their disposal.
That’s why many organizations have turned to Canto, a digital asset management platform that offers companies a single source of truth for all of their flyers, images, price lists and other digital content. Sales teams get on-demand access to everything they need, and marketers and content creators can easily curate and manage large collections of marketing collateral.
So what should brands using Canto for sales enablement keep in mind? We’ve rounded up some of the most impactful ways Canto helps empower sales teams to get compelling collateral in front of customers.
Give sales teams dedicated portals with everything they need
All too often, teams have content scattered all over the place – Google Drive, old Slack messages, individual devices. When they can’t find what they’re looking for, sales reps either lose precious minutes searching, or have to ask for assistance and wait for a response.
With a dedicated portal for sales collateral in Canto, sales reps always know exactly where to find current, relevant content that’s approved to share with customers. Because Canto Portals can be custom configured and accessed anywhere, they’re an especially ideal solution for large, complex sales organizations.
The marketing team at Oceaneering, a multinational provider of offshore engineering expertise, knows the challenge of complex sales enablement first-hand. They deliver collateral for a remarkably diverse range of products and services to hundreds of sales representatives around the world. “We exist to enable our sales team, to make selling easier, to help them outperform the competition,” explains Omeid Rahimian, a project manager for global marketing and communications at Oceaneering. “Canto helps us achieve these objectives and is a huge boon to the marketing team.”
Custom settings and filters help sales reps find content in seconds
Sales reps need to react to changing customer needs at the speed of business. With customizable tags and filters, you can make it easy to search Canto according to criteria that make sense to your sales team.
To make everything searchable, Canto tags new content automatically with image recognition, facial recognition and text search capabilities. You can also add custom metadata categories tailored to your business – product groups, seasons, project sites and more. When sales reps can filter and search according to the criteria that matter most to customers, they can pinpoint the perfect piece of collateral in just a few clicks.
This tailored experience is key for brands like Shuttercraft, one of the UK’s leading providers of shutters and blinds. Shuttercraft sales reps meet with customers in stores and on-site in their homes. They’re constantly showcasing photos on the fly, so they need to be able to find specific images and collections without interrupting the flow of conversation.
“Customers having shutters done in their bedroom want to see examples of bedroom shutters – and maybe even a specific type of install in a bedroom,” explains franchise marketing manager Clarissa Hearn. Because Shuttercraft’s images are tagged by room, product style and even season in Canto, sales reps can instantly filter for photos of the right product in the right context.
“We put in a lot of work to be able to deliver the service that the franchise network expects from us,” says Clarissa, who’s responsible for ensuring Shuttercraft sales reps have access to the images they need. “Success is all about delivery. Canto is a tool that’s helping us do that much more efficiently.”
Take outdated content out of circulation with version controls and expiration dates
Still seeing flyers with your old logo floating around? When sales reps store and manage sales collateral on their own devices, it can be hard to ensure outdated content stops going out to potential customers.
In Canto, sales reps have easy access to approved content – and approved content only. Activate and deactivate seasonal assets automatically with expiration dates, or use version controls to hide previous versions from view when you upload updated collateral.
Before switching to Canto, Limor Baruch of SolarEdge struggled to take outdated content out of circulation, “Everybody kept assets on their own local drives and just kept re-using them,” she explains. SolarEdge now has division-specific portals in Canto. Because she can update content in the portals whenever there’s a change, Limor can now be confident that her colleagues have the correct version.
“I wouldn’t use the word lifesaving, but it feels like it is,” says Limor. “We have completely changed the way we are working. SolarEdge personnel can now access digital assets at any time without having to go through me.”

Ultimately, sales enablement is about marketing and sales teams working together towards a common goal. When sales teams can easily access the right collateral on demand, everybody wins.

September 13, 2019|
I’ve been home 5 days, and I have to say, I’m still thinking about it. Content Marketing World was incredible. Its appeal stemmed in equal parts from the content it produced and the people it attracted. How do we combine the talent and the content we have to create something that leaves an impression? Content Marketing World sought to answer that question.
The event brought together a strong collection of seasoned digital marketers. The floor and sessions were constantly abuzz with intelligent people eager to learn. Topics ranged from how to build the bones of a successful content strategy all the way out to how to best leverage artificial intelligence in order to enhance your campaigns.
Personally, I found myself enchanted by the conversations around artificial intelligence. It’s an interesting scenario we find ourselves in with AI: how do we best leverage a power previously unseen in a way that brings tangible benefit? In his session, Chris Penn, the co-founder of Trust Insights, marvelously quantified what seems like a very qualitative question. He showed ways to draw insights, but perhaps most importantly, ways to implement the teachings into your process immediately. All of a sudden, something as cutting-edge as AI felt entirely familiar.
CMW’s vendors were well-chosen. Each sponsor was specifically equipped to aid in finding ideal answers to some of content marketing’s central questions. How do we best optimize and distribute our content? How do we achieve higher conversion rates? How do I find my brand’s voice?
There are whole hosts of different suites of technologies one could use along the path of finding those answers. There is no “perfect” tech-stack, just various permutations that may work better or worse.
Choosing your ideal content marketing suite is a bit like being an anesthesiologist: how do I find the perfect mixture of solutions to produce the desired effect? Between DAMs, webinar insights, social-posting platforms, video production platforms and more, there are innumerable solutions. From the educational sessions to the consultative vendors, CMW did a phenomenal job helping the attendees get closer to uncovering the proverbial “pot of gold.”
The fusing of the minds between vendor and end-user didn’t end at the sessions. The Content Institute knows how to have a good time! The first night’s event was a cocktail party at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The next one was hosted at an arcade bar with a mini-golf area, a rooftop and your choice of ‘Content Cocktails.’ Each of these events was well-curated, and the camaraderie was tangible. I had the opportunity to hang out with bright minds from across the digital ecosystem, vice presidents from enterprise content management software companies to content creators from fledgling agencies alike. There wasn’t a soul in that room that didn’t know how to have a good time. More powerful still, there wasn’t a soul in that room who wasn’t intelligent with an appetite for learning still more, and therein lies the key to breeding better and better ideas.
Content Marketing World was a blast. There’s not a doubt in my mind that Canto will be back, and I with it."

October 17, 2018|
You’ve heard it about public speaking before – if you’re nervous, picture the audience in their underwear. This advice rarely helps anybody. The reason this doesn’t work is it’s a passive solution. It implies the audience holds so much power over us that the only way we can overcome them is make them seem ‘less-intimidating’. We are trying to make a presentation memorable and possibly life-changing so we can sell a product or an idea or a solution.
Taking full control of the presentation – Gain power over the audience
It’s a battlefield. It’s you against them. You have to attack, not passively lessen your fear. Imagine all the failed or even marginal presenters who have not won over the audience. Hundreds of millions of them used the same old advice about hand gestures or imagining the audience in undergarments. Even if everything goes okay – okay is failure with presentations. People pitch multi-million dollar ideas that fail because the presentation doesn’t attack the audience. It totters on fear and mediocrity.
At the start of your presentation, the pressure is on you. The focus is on what you have to offer. By the end of it, the pressure should be on them. Put them onto the edge of their seat and make them feel like you’re giving them something they need to consider.
The most memorable speech I’ve heard didn’t come from a Fortune 500 CEO, but from my fourth grade teacher.
Seeing or hearing something you’ve never even imagined
My classmates and I intensely watched him hold his closed hand above his head, and slowly lower it to his mouth. The classroom filled with noise – laughter, speculation and grossed out moans. Some students remained silent, but this silence was infinitely more powerful than a student held as a result of an order of “Be quiet!”. My teacher had just caught a fly and put it into his mouth.
The material of his lesson was the same as every other teacher’s at my school – boring, bland babble that interested no one. Even worse, he wasn’t a good public speaker. He was more reserved than other teachers, and if he were on stage in front of judges for a debate contest, his marks would be noticeably poor. And yet, to this day I still remember every little detail about his speech. I sat wide-eyed through it, listening to the material he prepared with an open mind, craving to hear more. My teacher caught a living fly with his hand at the start of his speech. This was more attention-grabbing than clapping or yelling “quiet”. He was about to begin his speech, and he had just put a fly into his mouth. He stood still, mouth-closed for five seconds, then whoosh – he made a spitting sound and out flew the insect, buzzing around toward the windows.
I was in the fourth grade when I learned the true key to an effective presentation. The material, the charisma of the speaker, the way their speech was structured – none of it mattered much. Captivating an audience isn’t obtained through cliched anecdotal attempts or a shocking fact at the start of the speech. Captivation of an audience begins when the audience sees something they’ve never in their lives seen before.
Not a gimmick, but a link to your main points that will spread
A presentation is limited by the number of people who can see and hear it. Sure, webinars can be shared online for viewing, and someone may post a video of your speech on social media, but the true spreading of ideas comes from excited word-of-mouth sharing. This makes creating a captivating, memorable speech so important. Will people tell someone else about the idea you presented?
In the case of my teacher and the fly, the idea he preached that day spread throughout the school and beyond. This is because he took something we had never seen before and linked it to the main idea of his speech. The idea was that the fly had no choice in the events that took place. It tried to avoid capture but couldn’t. It then got placed into a mouth and couldn’t get out. When given the opportunity, it flew away. The message my teacher told us was how we were all like the fly and things will happen to us that are out of our control. At the end of it all, we have to be prudent enough to fly away and continue with our lives.
When we told others about the teacher who ate the fly, it reminded us of his message, and we would even sometimes tell the message as well. It becomes ingrained in us. It was over twenty years ago and I still remember it.
Construct presentations that keep audiences engaged
Building a presentation requires technical understanding of basic speech principles, but don’t settle on the bare minimum. Ensure the presentation is functional and coherent, but then add personalized life and feeling into it, the way you would a story or song.
Knowing now the requirements for a highly successful speech, focus on what images, music or videos will build upon the message of your presentation. Zero in on specific ideas and begin searching based on keywords that are in-sync with these ideas. Remember when selecting media for a presentation that each selection creates feelings for the audience. Whether they’re forgotten instantly or remembered and linked with the topic depends on how powerful and relevant your choice of media.
Building your presentations with consistent imagery is best done through the use of digital asset management. Canto DAM uses metadata, which gives the option to search media libraries using important keywords. Furthermore, DAM manages brand logos and keeps company presentations on brand.
I ran into my old teacher a few years ago in a grocery market. I eventually asked him, “How did you do that fly thing?” He smiled, knowing exactly what I was talking about despite it being such a long time before. He responded, “I put it into my mouth. For real.” His answer didn’t really matter at that point. All that mattered was he used something I had never seen to make me remember an idea in a presentation. Every presenter has a fly trick of their own, they just need to find it and make their presentation memorable."

Choosing a digital asset management (DAM) system can be overwhelming. What features matter most? What do you need to know to compare options?
To make the process easier, we’ve put together an overview of key considerations, so you can shop confidently and pick the best digital asset management software for your team.
How does the pricing work?
At its core, digital asset management pricing is based on two factors: number of seats and storage requirements. But teams shopping for a DAM software also need to be on the lookout for hidden costs. Some digital asset management companies charge extra for basic functions, like sharing portals, image smart-tagging, reporting, and integrations with other software.
Fortunately, it’s easy to find out how much your company can expect to pay for a DAM: Just ask! A reliable vendor will discuss your needs upfront and give you an idea of what you can expect to pay.
Can you share collections with specific audiences?
Most teams’ DAM requirements go beyond simple digital asset management. They also need to deliver content collections to different audiences, both internally and externally. That requires a DAM software with flexible sharing tools, like Canto Portals.
Consider who needs access to your content — including sales teams, distributors, customers, and agencies — and ensure your new DAM solution will allow you to easily deliver curated content collections to anyone.
How steep is the learning curve?
DAM software makes your organization’s content accessible. Look for a system that packages all of the powerful DAM features you need in an intuitive interface — so your team can hit the ground running.
Also consider ease of use for external users. Do they need an account to add and retrieve content? Or can you share individual assets, upload links, and public or password-protected portals without much fuss?
Does it integrate with the other tools your team relies on?
Integrations speed up your workflows by connecting your content library with the software you use every day. Look for out-of-the-box integrations with tools like Adobe Creative Cloud, Workfront, and Microsoft Office. Need something more niche? Your DAM solution should offer a robust API, so your developers can connect it with any application you like.
Is it video compatible?
If video is part of your content strategy, the best media asset management software for your team will make it easy to work with video. Can you preview video files without exporting them? Can you trim videos to download just the clips you need? Is there a Premiere Pro integration? Not all DAM systems are video compatible, so make sure to try before you buy.
Some digital asset management software providers even offer advanced video features, like video smart tags, facial recognition, and the ability to embed video hosted on the platform directly to your website.
Can you configure it to make it your own?
Every organization is a unique ecosystem of people, processes and procedures. Your DAM system should adapt to your team and industry. Are there customizable fields to categorize assets and filter search results in a way that makes sense? Can you brand the interface and external portals with your logo, colors and imagery? Consider how easy these configurations are to implement. Is it a simple setting adjustment, or does it require custom code?
Is it secure?
Keep your digital assets safe by ensuring your DAM provider uses proper encryption and security protocols. Where will your assets be stored? Is the data center secure? A reputable DAM provider should make security and data protection a priority in product development, and shouldn’t hesitate to discuss it if you have any questions.
Do they offer high-quality, ongoing customer service?
Choose a trusted vendor with an established track record of providing DAM services to major brands. DAM is a complex field, and it takes time to build up the expertise to serve clients well.
Look for a DAM vendor that will provide ongoing customer care from an experienced support team. Do your research and read independent reviews to learn about customers’ experiences first-hand.
Choosing a digital asset management platform doesn’t have to be hard
Ultimately, the choice of a digital asset management provider comes down to the question of value for money. You need a platform that delivers all the digital asset management capabilities your team needs, at a competitive price, while keeping the experience simple and intuitive.
That’s why Canto is a favorite of top brands across industries. Unlike other providers’ rigid platforms, Canto adapts to how your team works — delivering powerful features in a simple, intuitive package."

July 1, 2021|
At Canto, we’ve helped thousands of companies take control of their media libraries and manage their digital assets. After talking to so many teams about what they need from a professional-level media library, we’ve noticed a clear trend: Companies want cloud-based solutions.
It’s easy to see why. The software as a service (SaaS) model combines the convenience of cloud storage with built-in tools to help you get the most out of your digital assets.
But it’s not all about convenience and fancy features. There are a whole host of reasons companies are moving their assets to cloud-based media libraries like Canto.
Reason #1: Lower cost
Setting up an on-premise digital asset management system is an expensive undertaking. With a cloud-based library, you don’t need to configure on-site servers or hire experts to maintain your system. The software is ready to go when you subscribe and stays current with automated updates.
Most critically, you only pay for the storage you need.
For large organizations, the SaaS model is a major money-saver. For small companies with limited resources, the expense of an on-premise system would be out of the question. The flexible pricing of cloud-based tools make sophisticated, professional-level digital asset management an option at any price point.
Reason #2: Limitless scalability
Growing companies need a media library that will scale with them. When your library is on the cloud, you’ll never outgrow it. Once you’re set up, you can say goodbye to server upgrades and cumbersome migrations to a whole new system. As you grow, simply scale up your library with the click of a button or an email to your service rep.
Reason #3: Easy remote access
Whether working from home, meeting a client in the field or collaborating with someone in another office, most teams these days need to access their media libraries from multiple locations.
On-premise solutions require complicated VPNs – or worse, cut you off from your assets altogether if you’re not on site. With cloud solutions, you can log in on any device – or even use a mobile app – all while maintaining high standards of security.
Reason #4: Cutting-edge features
As providers focus on the tools that serve customers best, the cloud is where the most exciting innovations in digital asset management are happening.
We’ve seen droves of brands switching from on-premise solutions to Canto, so we know customers value time-saving innovations. We’re constantly adding new features and finding ways to make organizing, using and sharing assets even easier.
With a cloud-based solution, you can expect the latest and greatest in digital asset management, and frequent updates that keep your library state-of-the-art.

March 27, 2020|
Closed platform systems govern the way a system is used, including the manner in which a certain program operates. It’s important to understand the concept at a basic level and know when to implement it in your company. Here are some important reasons to consider using closed platform and how it differentiates from open platform.
What is a closed platform?
A closed platform software structure regulates the way users operate within its system. It allows the company licensing out its software to maintain control of how a user behaves on its program. For example, in a kid’s bedroom, the child can play with the toys inside of it but once they want a toy from the store, the parent has to approve. The child is the end user, the bedroom is the software and the parent is the software company.
Closed platform restricts content and outside applications. It often rejects content it doesn’t approve usually because the makers of the content refused to pay a licensing fee. Outside applications are restricted because they drastically change the software or program outside of its original intent, which threatens company standards. Though restriction can often have negative connotations, a closed platform isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, the restrictions can be a positive in many ways. Before we address whether or not you should consider them extensively, here’s a direct comparison of the open and closed platforms.
How does closed platform differ from open platform?
Closed platform differs from an open platform in functionality. Open platform systems allow incorporation from other programs to offer different functions of the original software. Furthermore, open platform allows end users to manipulate the originally intended purpose of the program. A restrictive program prevents these variations. Below are some more distinct examples showing how these two different program types operate.
Open platform systems have different capabilities, such as the potential to implement APIs within the software program. It also allows users a chance to use the software systems in a manner that wasn’t originally intended by the software creator. In fact, there is often a chance for users to edit and reprogram the code within an open platform system. All of these potential functionalities of the open platform programs are, of course, unavailable to the closed platform systems.
Should an enterprise consider this system?
Imagine buying a new car and modifying its horn to produce sounds that reach dangerous volume levels. This modification might be something a small amount of users may want from a car but a majority of users want the company-installed horn. From the company’s end of this scenario, the modification may give their brand a bad name, as other drivers become frustrated with their model car blaring loud noises. This is an example of when closed platform benefits a business more than open platform.
One thing that stands out with a closed platform is security. The coding of a large enterprise is made with security in mind. That security stays intact with these types of systems. Customers require support from the software company as well, though it’s difficult to navigate a support problem if the initial code is altered or third party applications are installed. If security is one of the most important aspects of a lot of your work, this system might best suit you.
A company concerned with the misuse or theft of its content within a closed platform system should consider automated maintenance of digital content. The best solution for this is a digital rights management (DRM) system. Along with a DRM, they should consider the benefits of closed platform software."

Make sure you understand all the key details concerning the cloud backup. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you out.
What is cloud backup?
A cloud backup service stores files at a remote location, freeing up your personal hard drive space. The cloud is an online data storage center that uses online-based servers. Cloud backup ensures all of a user’s important files are saved for future recovery if necessary.
A cloud backup is similar to a bank account. Rather than saving money at your home, you give it to a bank and they store it for you. This way, if something were to happen to your home, you wouldn’t lose a lot of money. Likewise, if your hard drive breaks, the cloud backup is there to give you recovery options so no valuable data is lost.
Is it secure?
Cloud backup is only as safe as the provider. Furthermore, it’s technically less safe than storing files on a personal hard drive, as these are in your sole possession and not subject to outside parties. There are a few things to consider when determining whether a system is safe. The first is whether the program has a history of security issues or breaches. If your research concludes a pattern of hacks, mistakes or any other security problems, consider a different option.
Another way to determine if your backup option is secure is checking out its specifications. For example, end-to-end encryption is a nice benefit to look for. This means that the only parties capable of viewing the information are the sending and receiving party and no one else. In this case, your files would be shared to the cloud and no one else could access them.
How do I backup to the cloud?
This all depends on which system you use and what type of device you’re using. For example, smartphones can be backed up to the cloud. Depending on the type of phone you have, there’s typically options in the settings to allow it. Check your phone to see where it’s currently storing information.
In order to learn how to backup to the cloud, you’ll first have to select the system you wish to use for all potential restores and storage. Once you’ve made a decision, it’s important to read their specific guidelines for backup. Most systems have a button you click which should open up a window, allowing you to import specific files. There’s also usually a way to sync your entire hard drive to their cloud program.
What are some benefits?
The main benefit of a cloud backup is the safety net it offers in case your computer or hard drive inexplicably errors. We all have some types of valuable data or files we need saved – cloud backup makes the process easy. Not only does it protect your files, it’s also a capable storage option.
For companies, it is ideal because of the secure file sharing. Organizations are able to securely transfer files to clients without worrying about outside parties seeing them. A cloud backup also gives businesses more leeway with their IT department, creating opportunities for them to focus efforts elsewhere.
What are the best backup services?
With the rapid growth of data, there’s a much greater need for a cloud backup. Fortunately, a lot of services exist to choose from. Dropbox, Box, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive all stand out as popular options. However, none of them really elevate above their peers. Companies want sophisticated storage that does much more than backup and store files. That’s why they’re overwhelmingly choosing digital asset management.
Digital asset management (DAM) backs up files securely while offering users many different tools to search and share. It’s a comprehensive enterprise system that accelerates workflows and integrates with numerous applications. Use DAM if you want a system that caters to your specific cloud backup needs.
A cloud backup saves time and resources if implemented correctly. Make sure you understand the types of benefits it offers before deciding to use one."

November 13, 2019|
Cloud storage is a growing necessity with the exponential expansion of digital data. It’s important to implement a system that complements your existing tools and systems. Furthermore, make sure you have a thorough understanding of each potential program. The following is a detailed list of five cloud storage providers that are superior to other systems.
1. pCloud
pCloud is best known for its extensive security features. In fact, security is the main reason pCloud manages to stay in the elite group of cloud storage providers. It has in-depth folder encryption and high-level password protection. Though security is what it hangs its hat on, it’s loaded with other features that make it a top provider.
pCloud takes pressure off companies to secure IT training for the service. It’s an easy-to-use software that is constantly updating features, which doesn’t require downtime for a company. It even provides top-notch mobile accessibility and dynamic file organization.
2. Canto DAM
Canto digital asset management (DAM) excels as a cloud storage provider due to its comprehensive media storage, metadata capabilities, and enterprise-friendly system. DAM lets teams quickly search for stored items from a centralized library on the cloud. It also organizes large amounts of data and files for companies.
DAM boasts great security, a result of the AWS implementation in its system. It also lets businesses increase the protection of files from copyright infringement with its automated watermarking system. Consider DAM when you have large amounts of media files that need to be expertly sorted.
3. Google Drive
Google Drive is a staple in the cloud storage provider industry because of its simplicity and collaboration potential. Drive gives teams the chance to quickly edit, share and store different files on the cloud. It’s a very easy system to maneuver and it doesn’t require much technical know-how to operate. This boosts company efficiency and ensures users of all skill level have input in the editing process of a project.
The instantaneous appearance of newly edited text in a document make Google Drive a success, especially for enterprises. Teams are able to work together on different uploaded documents and see the changes they make in real time. This allows for efficient and accurate projects.
4. Microsoft OneDrive
Microsoft OneDrive stands alone as the only system that can provide a valuable integration with the popular Microsoft suite software (Word, Powerpoint, etc.). This seems like a cheap way to gain traction in the race to make the best cloud storage software. However, this integration has plenty of value. Microsoft is banking on the fact that so many organizations already use their Microsoft tools. As a result, their cloud system is easy to implement.
It’s clear that OneDrive is best for teams that already use the Microsoft Suite extensively. If most of your files, tools and projects run through Microsoft products, OneDrive is probably the right choice for you. Even if you use mostly Microsoft applications, it’s still important to compare the features of OneDrive to other systems.
5. Dropbox
Dropbox is the tried and true option of the cloud providers. It remains the most popular system available on the market. Even though it’s not perfect, it’s a highly functional system for all types of users. Dropbox is easy-to-use, low-priced and filled with great features.
Dropbox’s security has been an issue but it has worked hard to improve in that regard. In fact, it has successfully improved many areas of concern. Consider Dropbox if you’re looking to implement a cloud system that can handle the basics of your company storage.
The cloud storage world is changing rapidly. These five systems seem to remain on top throughout constant change. Find which of them best fits your needs to boost your cloud storage efficiency."

March 4, 2020|
Companies are increasingly using both content management systems and enterprise content management systems to bolster their success. On the surface, these two types of software tools seem alike. However, upon further studying it becomes clear that both have unique differences that require some attention. This guide will break down these differences and give you an idea of which you should be using. First, here’s a brief rundown of the two systems.
What is CMS?
A CMS (content management system) is software used to manage digital content. CMS’ include format control, version control, search and retrieval. It’s also used to deliver content quickly and efficiently. A good example of a CMS is WordPress, an open-source system. Though it has many different uses, the most common is some type of enterprise use, usually involving web content.
What is ECM?
ECM (Enterprise Content Management) is the way in which business content is stored, shared, maintained and secured. ECM helps control a company’s data, information, presentations and documents. This is due to the fact it typically involves implementing processes for projects and creation. It maps out and structures different types of content pieces for all types of companies.
Now that you have a good understanding of both CMS and ECM, let’s learn how they’re different and how they’re similar.
What’s the difference between CMS and ECM?
CMS and ECM differ in a few ways, particularly in the type of different content they each store and share. The two are nearly polar opposites when it comes to the file types and media they handle effectively. For example, things like word documents (DOC, DOCX) or professional documents (PDF), are handled perfectly by a CMS. An ECM, on the other hand, is the superior option when it comes to content such as images, audio and video files. Take note of this difference if deciding between the two systems.
Another way these two differ is in the way they handle differently-sized companies. CMS works better in smaller-sized enterprises a little bit better. This is because it’s just an easier way to handle content in small doses. Think of it like a tiny car and a big car trying to fit into a small parking spot. The ECM, on the other hand, handles the larger companies better because of how wide-ranging its capabilities are in terms of handling content. Next, let’s check out the ways in which these two systems are alike.
What are some similarities of CMS and ECM?
A lot of what ECM does is interchangeable with CMS. They both promote enterprise content organization and solutions. Similarly, they bring with them favorable benefits to companies. One example is efficient project completion. Both ECM and CMS handle content in a way which keeps companies efficient. This type of efficiency is usually spurred by the ways in which these programs are able to provide manageable, comprehensive tools for projects.
Another way they’re the same is with their integrative capabilities. When companies use either the ECM or the CMS systems, they’re able to integrate their tools with the systems they already have in place. Think of this like someone syncing with another or meshing with them in a productive way. ECM and CMS have immense integration qualities. For example, they both integrate with the popular Microsoft Suite. This saves a lot of time, especially when first implementing these programs.
Where does DAM fit into all this?
Digital asset management (DAM) is a part of the ECM branch, however, it’s a much more specific and focused component. This is most noticeable in the way DAM organizes, stores and shares digital content. In particular, it handles digital assets – images, videos, audio files, presentations and other digital content. Ensure you know the nuanced differences between the DAM, CMS and ECM, as it will likely come up at some point.
Dam is related to ECM because it’s an enterprise system. It’s particularly valuable when companies need a system to quickly share and retrieve stored content from a centralized location. Make sure when comparing ECM and CMS that you always include DAM into the process. This guarantees that you’re working with the best systems, or at least, the systems that best suit your company’s specific needs.
ECM and CMS are similar and different, so make sure you have a good understanding of how they’re the same and how they’re not. Chances are you’ll have to use them both at some point."
133,https://www.canto.com/blog/co-branding/,"You scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours: A comprehensive co-branding breakdown
September 4, 2020|
The hippopotamus doesn’t go it alone as a species. In fact, in order to clean themselves, they partner with a tiny fish called a barbell.
Without the hippo, the barbell wouldn’t find food as easily. Without the barbell, the hippo couldn’t stay clean.
This symbiotic relationship is like co-branding, in which two or more companies team up to create a product or service.
Oftentimes, these unifications seem like no-brainers. Others leave us scratching our heads, as if we had just seen a 3,000 pound hippo let a five pound fish into its mouth for some dental work.
This article will guide you through the concept of co-branding, while giving fresh insight into the process, as well as dynamic strategies.
Even if you’re a scary, large animal, there’s a partner for you somewhere. Let’s find one for you.
What is co-branding?
Co-branding is a strategic agreement between two or more companies. This partnership is beneficial through the use of multiple brand names, logos, jingles and other identifiers. Co-branding often amplifies a product or service through the power of numerous brands.
“Synergy – the bonus that is achieved when things work together harmoniously.” – Mark Twain
Note that co-branding is different from co-marketing, which is an arrangement that benefits from two different brands unifying marketing efforts. Co-branding, on the other hand, aims to introduce a new product or service to the market.
It’s exciting to think of all the possibilities that come with joining up with another company. Here’s a more detailed look at why co-branding is so important.
An in-depth breakdown of why co-branding is valuable
The importance of co-branding isn’t always obvious to those involved. Here are some of the lesser-understood benefits to consider.
Has exponential advertising potential
There’s just something about a multi-branded product that causes a stir. Maybe it’s the fact that fans of both brands get a double-excitement waiting for the release.
Or, it might be because both have their own target markets that are combine in anticipation, amplifying brand awareness.
Whatever the reason, the buzz and self-promotion of these products is phenomenal and requires minimal effort beyond product-production. Being attached to two different brands gives fans and followers a lot more to talk about (twice as much, technically).
Many companies’ most successful ventures are co-branded, and a lot of this success came from customer word-of-mouth advertisement.
Can mask your brand weaknesses with other brand strengths
“Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” – Helen Keller
In a basketball game, there are both short and tall players.
The taller players usually have problems dribbling, while the shorter player has problems protecting the basket. However, since they’re on the same team, they mask each other’s weaknesses.
A co-branding, when done correctly, brings about the same potential. For example, if one brand is known for their musical understanding but lacks technical know-how, and another brand has technical skills, a collaboration hides the first’s tech limitations.
Eliminates a large chunk of risks involved
One of the main reasons these relationships are favorable is they cut down on common risks brands face when releasing new products and services.
Here’s an example to illustrate this: Imagine there’s a group of 100 people – ½ of them are familiar with Brand A, while ½ are familiar with Brand B.
If Brand A and B unite to release a product, the familiarity these 100 have with one or the other make it easier to make a purchase.
Similarly, if ‘A’ is known to make mediocre products, but ‘B’ is known to make exceptional products, this again makes it easier for a purchase.
Allows brands to jump into new markets
Let’s face it – some brands aren’t going to capture certain markets no matter what product they introduce. It’s just not possible due to differences in cultural values, location or ideals.
Sometimes, a brand’s customer locations are vastly different from another’s, allowing for a potential target market extension when partnered.
The most common barrier between breaking into a new market is the type of customer-base within a section. However, if it’s within reason (ie, not a candy company partnering with a toothpaste company), a partnership opens up new market possibilities.
There are a lot of positives surrounding these relationships. Let’s look at some of the most successful historical examples of co-branding.
Key examples to examine
1. Doritos and Taco Bell
This one is first on the list because of all the buzz it got (and still gets). As you’ll notice with all the examples I use, these brands already have something in common. In this case, the shared commonality is food products.
The product: If you aren’t already aware, in the 2010s, Taco Bell partnered with Doritos to create the ‘Doritos Locos Tacos’. This item used all the ingredients of a normal Taco Bell taco, only it added the flavorings of a Doritos chip for the shell.
The results: So, how well did this partnership work out? The Doritos Locos Tacos were Taco Bell’s most successful product launch ever, with 100 million selling the first ten weeks.
Other food brands even attempted similar partnerships and eating-synergies to capture the success of the new taco.
2. Michael Jordan and Nike
There are two main similarities between Jordan and Nike: athletics. Nike is committed to athletic gear, and Michael Jordan is a professional athlete.
The product: Almost anywhere in the world it’s possible to see a pair of shoes that have the logo pictured below. This silhouetted athlete is Michael Jordan, and the shoes are called ‘Air Jordans’ or ‘Nike Air Jordans’.
The results: Both Michael Jordan and Nike have made billions of dollars from this partnership. And keep in mind that this only includes direct purchases of the Air Jordan shoes. This doesn’t consider the fact that seeing Nike now makes customers think of Jordan and vice-versa.
3. Bonne Bell and Tootsie Roll
This is one of my favorite pairings in history because of the creativity and subtlety. Sure, it’s easy to pair two different foods together, or a celebrity with a product, but this took outside-the-box thinking.
The product: Bonne Bell creates the Lip Smacker product, a flavored lip balm. Tootsie Roll creates a chocolate bar. They teamed up in the 1980s to offer Tootsie Roll-flavored lip balm. It sounds weird at first, but the sweet flavor of the Tootsie Roll isn’t a stretch from the other Lip Smacker flavors offered.
The results: To this day you can find Tootsie Roll Lip Smacker on certain store shelves and online retailers. This partnership brought great exposure to both and cemented itself into vintage/retro fame.
4. Dairy Queen and Nestle
Dairy Queen is widely popular for their ice cream treats, especially the Blizzard, a cup of ice cream with special flavors. Nestle is also in the sweets business, putting out candy bars such as Crunch and ice cream products like the Drumstick.
The product: Combining the Dairy Queen ice cream with Nestle’s Crunch bar seemed like a no-brainer, creating a Crunch Blizzard. The concept was simple yet brilliant at the same time, putting chunks of the Crunch bar on top of the Blizzard ice cream.
The results: The Crunch Blizzard still exists and has even spawned further treat collaborations, such as the Drumstick Blizzard.
5. Apple and Mastercard
Apple normally sells products like phones, tablets and computers. Upon first glance, Mastercard doesn’t really fit into the equation.
However, Apple decided they wanted to create their own credit card. Mastercard took full advantage of the opportunity to co-brand and be a part of the process.
The product: The no-number Apple Mastercard. This unique payment option was one of the first ways to chang how people paid for things. The innovation and brand loyalty of Apple combined with the experience of Mastercard assured users this product was safe and effective.
The results: This concept gave iPhone users a chance to pay for items in a different way. It also increased security for these types of processes, which is a huge plus comparatively.
Potential downsides to consider
“It is far better to be alone, than to be in bad company.” – George Washington
So far, we’ve talked about the amazing benefits that come along with partnering up. Now it’s time to point out the potential negatives.
Remember that, even though there are some unfavorable aspects, this is true for all methods of branding. I’m not listing the negatives to discourage you. Rather, this gives you a chance to prepare for and avoid any pitfalls.
Watch out for the following co-branding issues.
Company culture clash
The resulting product or service created by a partnership isn’t the only thing to consider. Even if two brands come up with something creative and innovative, it can fall apart if their cultures don’t align.
This happens when brands have opposing values, a different brand image or don’t see eye-to-eye on certain issues. For example, if one felt strongly about the environment, but the other used plastic bottles, a co-branding would be illogical.
Not only could it cause friction between the two brands working side-by-side, it may also send the wrong message to their target markets.
Their baggage becomes your baggage
No matter how strongly you’ve built up your brand, it doesn’t take much for it to get knocked down. A co-branding has this potential, unfortunately.
If one brand is successful and in general good standing with their target market, working with a second brand may hurt them, especially if this other party brings baggage.
Whatever public issues the partnering brand brings to the relationship become yours. This includes things like past failed products and campaigns.
Money, money, money
One of the most complicated aspects of an agreement is the financial issues that come with it. This requires a lot of effort, planning and causes potential future problems.
Before any partnership happens, there are usually extensive hoops to jump through, documents to draw up and financial agreements to be made. This takes time and resources.
Also, just because a relationship is in good standing at the beginning of the process, doesn’t mean it will be later on. Things can get complicated very quickly, especially if one of the brands in the agreement feels like they’re being slighted.
The above downsides are pretty scary, but if you take the necessary precautions, a co-branding has enough upside to make it worth it.
Now let’s move into some helpful strategies.
Beneficial co-branding strategies
I came up with the following strategies to give you a clear path to success when considering your own co-branding.
Remember: Similar but different
“Individually we are one drop; but together we are an ocean.” – Ryunosoke Satoro
First and foremost: these partnerships won’t work if the two brands are too similar or too different – brand differentiation is still valuable here. A nationwide automobile repair brand has no business pairing with a bread brand. Apple has no business pairing with Microsoft. Gatorade shouldn’t team up with Powerade.
Co-branding is only effective when done with similar yet different brands. Here’s an example to consider:
Let’s say Nike decides they want to partner up with another brand to create excitement around their new shoeline. They team up with another athletic-performance goods giant, Adidas. This is a clear example of ‘too similar’, and sometimes leads to brand dilution.
Many Nike fans wouldn’t be interested in Adidas and vice-versa. Also, the product itself would likely fail. Both thrive at making shoes. Having them each create one together is a recipe for disaster.
Instead, imagine that Nike seeks out the brand ‘Cute Laces’ and works with them. Nike could build the shoe while Cute Laces adds a signature design to the laces. This shows why it’s so important to be similar (shoes and shoelaces) instead of the same (shoes and shoes).
Ask yourself, “what would this add of value”?
No one will be interested in buying a product simply because it has two brands they like on the label. There needs to be a reason for every co-branding, and this reason has to give value to the customer.
A helpful question to ask is, how would this improve upon the current product? Make sure your answer is more extensive than a gimmick.
Once you’ve determined the benefits, it’s a lot easier to break down the different factors to see if the idea works in the long run.
Create a structured, clear proposal
This is one of the most necessary parts of the entire co-branding process, as it ensures both parties get what they want out of the agreement.
You might have the most innovative, creative product in-mind, but if your proposal doesn’t relay that vision correctly, the other might decline.
Make sure that your proposal is clear and detailed. Lay everything all out on the table for your potential partner brand.
Next, let them know what you require going forward, and ask them to do the same. Finally, present a potential schedule to give them an idea of how long you plan on the partnership taking.
These strategies only work if you’ve done your research and have the necessary tools in place to succeed.
Taking the next step
Some pairings work, others do not. At the end of the day, your audience expects any brand relationships you form to work seamlessly. If you have to explain the partnership or product, chances are it’s not a good fit.
Consider all the positives that come from a successful co-branding. If you believe your brand has a chance to capture these potential rewards, make it happen!

March 11, 2020|
Last week, the Canto team went to COEx | Photo Studio Ops | NYC to learn from the best in the creative operations industry. After what felt like a 2-day masterclass in photo studio operations, I came away inspired and excited to help solve the challenges of creative professionals looking to scale their own in-house photography efforts!
Here are three big takeaways I had from COEx | Photo Studio Ops | NYC.
Lesson 1: Due diligence in pre-production makes all the difference!
I moderated a panel with four in-house photography production experts from Walmart, Rent the Runway, Sperry and Rue Gilt Groupe. It was fascinating to get a peek of how much work goes on behind-the-scenes, even weeks before a shoot.
At Rent the Runway, pre-production may start four weeks before a shoot, while at Rue Gilt, the team may only have seven days. The teams also have to factor in curveballs such as delayed samples and changes in creative direction or products.
Takeaways ranged from person to person: Mark Thayer, photo studio manager at Sperry, said his secret sauce is to “standardize and automate everything,” while Heather Johnson, director of production, photography and retouching at Rent The Runway, said her best advice is to “make friends with everyone.” But a common thread was the need to do your homework and stay flexible as plans change.
Lesson 2: DAM is key to scaling in-house photo production
We’re seeing more companies invest in in-house content creation, but it can be hard to scale in-house production to meet demands. John J. Kelly, III, Senior Managing Photographer at FreshDirect, gave a great talk on how he was able to increase lifestyle and editorial photography by 150 percent over four years, and still and product photography by 105 percent, over five years.
John began as a “one-person show” and gradually brought on part-time assistants whom he trained to take on various parts of the production process. At a critical point when the team was pushing the limits of their old system, he implemented a DAM solution to help the team step up their content creation.
By immediately pushing final photography assets into FreshDirect’s DAM after a shoot, John essentially enables the entire company to access the photos they needed instantaneously. His philosophy is to upload assets first, then apply tags and metadata second, which does not create a bottleneck for teams contingent on his content. His “laundry rule” of not letting assets go longer than 7 days without being properly tagged ensures that every asset in the DAM eventually gets the necessary metadata to be searchable for years.
Lesson 3: Innovate, but don’t forget you’re making content for humans!
We’re always hearing that brands need to innovate and create fresh content that stands out. I really enjoyed the perspective I got from the Fireside Chat with Steve Giralt, visual engineer and founder of The Garage, a production company that creates internet-breaking visuals by combining art and engineering.
While The Garage loves using technology to achieve the coolest special effects, they keep in mind that the content they’re creating has to appeal to real-life people. That’s where creativity comes into play – it’s not about using the coolest technology, necessarily, but making art that captures a person’s attention and tells a story.
In Steve’s words, “appetite appeal is everything…make [content] look so good that it actually makes you want to eat it.”"
135,https://www.canto.com/blog/cold-data-storage/,"Cold data storage: How it works and why it matters
June 3, 2021|
Managing cold data storage allows a business to prioritize files and develop strong organizational practices. Let’s look at what cold data storage involves and how it works to improve business functionality.
What is cold data storage?
Cold data is inactive data that retains information. The separation of rarely used and daily used information means data belongs in specific locations. Often businesses will have a tiering system for data relating to usage time frames before determining information is in need of storage. If data isn’t used, archiving gives structure to increasing volumes of unstructured data sets.
Cold data storage is an economical practice. The information remains static for long periods and makes room for active information.
3 reasons for cold storage:
- Preserving raw digital assets
- Governance and regulatory compliance
- Audit and analytic trails
Cold data can be stored offline on hard drives, on a cloud or on an internal server. Seldom this information needs to be accessed. If it does, then the process is slow because there is less of a rush.
It should also be noted that using data lineage tools helps separate redundant data from mainstream information and free up space on your servers.
How cold data storage works
This information (cold data) is considered valuable when inactive. Speed of access is not a priority, but managing where it is kept is. Good data management requires the ability to identify what information your business needs access to and what can be archived. Automation in this sense can be of huge assistance.
An example of cold data storage usage is Big Data. This information comes in huge sets of information and in order to be analyzed effectively needs to be broken down. Some of this information becomes redundant to a business’s daily operations. Computer nodes like Hadoop can process or maintain less used data automatically. This means data being used on a daily basis is more efficiently stored and ensures primary storage methods don’t become overwhelmed.
3 benefits of cold storage:
- Cost reduction
- Optimized data management
- Economical, efficient data storage
Cold storage versus hot storage
Hot data is actively used and available information. These sets of information flow daily and require speed. In order to function well, data needs to be on the front line and kept up to date. Removing cold data from your active server streamlines business operations. It also clarifies information and gives your team a boost of efficiency. These are key differences when considering cold storage versus hot storage.
In the modern world, data is a vital part of a business’s success from a legal, analytical and historic stance. Effective cold data storage means you have access to archived information when needed, freeing up space for teams to focus on immediate goals. Use the above information to better preserve, organize and store your data."

June 10, 2021|
How you process big data matters much more than you think. If datasets are well-managed, it has a direct impact on the success of your business operations. In this article, I break down cold and hot data storage, showing the key differences to consider when deciding how best to process information.
What is cold data storage?
In a sense, cold data storage is information your business can’t live without. You need it for things like industry compliance, human resources or digital production. Cold data is more static in comparison to information that’s accessible daily. This means it needs to be on hand but not on the front line of your storage systems.
Why cold data matters
The main purpose of cold storage information is to retain it for future reference. How you store cold data differs from how hot data is retained. It doesn’t require swift access or to live on servers that can be transferred at speed. Instead, hard drives, internal servers with basic functionality and secure cloud storage are viable options for cold data. A popular solution to storing cold data is Hadoop. This is an open-source file distribution system that can be set up to automate the process of dormant files and datasets. This can be run on commodity hardware that is cheaper to maintain.
3 cold data storage upsides:
- Data optimization
- Economical storage
- Cost reduction
What is hot data storage?
While cold data is kept in low-performance, economical storage that takes longer to access, hot storage requires high-performance functionality and speed. Accessible team files need to be instantly available on the latest servers and easily transferred. Amazon (AWS) offers a tiered storage system with hot data operating on advanced cloud storage servers.
Why hot data matters
Hot data is active information that evolves and is used daily. That means it has to be agile and ready to be shared amongst colleagues. The removal of cold data from servers makes room for hot datasets to flow. It also declutters systems to improve efficiency.
Separation of hot and cold storage
Hot and cold data both have their virtues but are defined by their differences. The benefits that come from separation have a big impact on the success of business operations.
5 benefits of data separation:
- Improved efficiency
- Enhanced dataset quality
- Modified tiering systems
- Decluttered storage space
- Prioritized information
Data is constantly evolving and how you analyze and prioritize information plays a starring role in best practices. The ability to automate your cold data and prioritize hot data has a positive influence on future success. Consider what your business and teams need now and later, and store information accordingly."
137,https://www.canto.com/blog/collaborative-design/,"Collaborative design – An explanation of this phase in the UX Process
October 11, 2019|
Collaborative design is the new norm for companies and learning the ins and outs of this phase are vital to the UX process. The following is a guide to collaborative design, including key ideas for developing, organizing and structuring the collaborative design phase.
What is collaborative design?
Collaborative design is a process that brings together different ideas, roles and team members. Collaborative design is a multi-staged UX (user experience) process that involves planning and strategy developed by user feedback. The design phase of the UX process is iterative.
Collaborative design is related to collaborative marketing and is part of a UX process that achieves different stages, along with design, to reach a final goal of a product or campaign. Imagine each UX process has a beginning, middle and end. The design phase is the middle, the research phase is the beginning and the launch phase is the end. Though this is a very simplified view of most UX processes, it helps you understand the grand scheme of where collaborative design falls into place.
A design phase is iterative
A design phase for a UX project is both collaborative and iterative. It’s collaborative in that it soaks up feedback and ideas from different people, sources and departments. It’s iterative because it then uses those ideas over and over again to polish them and reach a desirable end goal of a campaign. This is a three-step procedure: brainstorm, design and revise based on market feedback. By repeating these three steps, teams achieve close approximations of their design goals. Collaborative design teams are part of an iterative process that strengthens design integrity. They also are able to hone-in on client or market needs.
An example to demonstrate iteration is an ice cream store giving out taste tests of new flavored ice cream to a focus group. After a flavor is eaten, the test subject says what’s good or bad about it. The store then uses the feedback to refine the ice cream based on the preferences of the user. They then try the new improved flavor again on another test group to see if their changes have worked. This is the iteration process of the UX design phase in action.
Software to assist the design phase
Once design became mostly collaborative, companies followed suit by developing software that encouraged this process. It’s important to implement tools that coincide with the entire UX process for a campaign, particularly the design process. The right software furthers the collaboration possibilities through increased communication, file sharing and creativity.
Digital asset management (DAM) from Canto is optimized for giving teams structure and stability during the design phase of their collaboration. DAM has the power to unite teams and ideas during a project. For example, if a team is researching an idea, they can share their collective research files in a centralized library created within the DAM system. This allows for more connected teams during research and boosts strategies. Early planning of the design, be it sketches or graphs, are easily stored and shared. This allows full transparency of the direction the project is moving in. During the design phase, teams are able to use metadata tagging to locate and save files specific to design.
In order to develop strong user experience, collaborative design needs to be optimized. Remember these key features to correctly develop it."

October 1, 2019|
Collaborative marketing opens possibilities for your campaigns to thrive. Reaching target audiences is more accurate with the latest technology. Furthermore, modern marketing collaboration utilizes the right tools to reach a wider market.
What is collaborative marketing?
Collaborative marketing is a marketing strategy that involves working in unison with similar companies to promote brand, minimize costs and increase sales. Collaborative marketing bolsters exposure through side-by-side advertisement with competitors. It is a popular and effective system, especially in online presences.
Here are five unique tactics to make your collaborative marketing a success.
1. Utilize the power of consumers
Collaborative marketing is more than collaborating with other organizations. Modern technology gives us better outreach to capture the voice of your target audience. This continues to develop as the use of social media and wide-reaching digital reviews expand.
Put this concept to work for your organization. Continuously assess the involvement of consumers in your brand and marketing campaigns to reinforce relationships to the level of your organization’s needs. Try to collaborate with your target market by utilizing user generated content.
Organic growth in your brand and marketing campaigns is the result of user-driven collaborative marketing. Consumers boost your campaign naturally through word of mouth, social media and blogs – so give them the platform to interact. This is one of the simplest tactics for collaborative marketing but it’s also one of the most effective.
2. Fulfill campaign goals
Use collaborations to strategically mask your weaknesses or promotional shortcomings. Broaden your outreach with collaborative marketing that syncs with your organization. Relatable organizations will have similar goals, marketing campaigns and target audiences. Create mutually beneficial marketing promotions with these companies to fulfill the needs of your team.
When you bring this idea to modern collaborative marketing, you’ll need systems in place to enable this creative collaboration. The marketing technology stack your team is using should be configured to make this process as smooth as possible.
It’s essential to have the basic collaborative tools in place. The most important solution for marketing collaboration is digital asset management (DAM). This used by modern organizations for optimal brand management and asset storage. With DAM, you can easily collaborate on projects with externals through features like collection links and portals.
3. Align with like-minded businesses
Increase your brand awareness with collaboration. Work with other brands to promote similar products, which increases the outreach and strength of the advertisement. The marketing powers of numerous brands come together to bolster your business and minimize budget spending.
Here’s a real life example of this in action. Two different reputable Hollywood companies produce a movie. Though they are competitors, they solidify the quality of the film by collaborating. The brands build off each other this way, masking weaknesses and developing strengths in the eyes of consumers.
4. Plan the entire collaboration process
A strong collaboration is preceded by a systematic planning of the entire collaboration process. Begin by researching companies that have similar goals, marketing, brand and products. Especially online, marketing collaborations are more effective with higher amounts of collaborative companies. The next step is meeting with the collaborators and setting guidelines and agreements with each of them.
After the partnerships are formed, ensure all agreements are in place before launching the marketing advertisements. Finally, re-evaluate your campaign to ensure you’re constantly getting the most value from it. Ensure the companies you partnered with don’t change their goals or branding values without your knowledge.
5. Adapt to evolving organizational needs
Your collaborative marketing campaigns thrive when internal audits of collaborative relationships are routine. The needs of your organization are dynamic and the digital landscape changes constantly. In order to stay relevant and keep the collaborative marketing campaigns prosperous, regularly reassess both your organization’s needs and changes to the relationships with externals. Ensuring the relationship is still viable and beneficial to your organization will garner success.
Elevating your marketing campaigns begins with internal evaluations of collaborations. Keep your organization focused in order to succeed in collaborative efforts. Help your team feel responsible for taking ownership of collaborative marketing relationships."

March 24, 2022|
The pundits called it a decade ago. No. One. Watches. TV. Anymore. The golden age of the glowing tube in the nation’s home was over; killed by the internet, time-shift recording devices and streaming services like Netflix. And with it, the TV commercial. Ah, we can just fast forward through those with our remote, or hey … they just don’t exist in our subscription package. Gone. Forget the mythos of Mad Men and the creativity of Madison Avenue. Scratch 80 years of history that began with a 10 second pitch for Bulova watches during a Brooklyn Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies game in 1941. The TV ad was doomed to be a ghost of marketing campaigns past. Or so the pundits said.
So let’s get back to 2022. You’ll still hear the same commentary today: No one watches network TV. It is true that with changes in technology and demographics, our viewing habits have evolved. But, so too has the TV commercial. We now live in the era of the blockbuster ad. The grand narrative ad. The TV ad that’s the hero of an omnichannel campaign.
From Super Bowl to Santa Claus Is Coming to Town
We are suckers for drama — the idea that one decisive moment can change everything if only we can get it right just when it matters most. It’s the narrative that plays out every year in the shape of one 30-second TV slot costing $6.5 million screened during the Super Bowl. In this narrative, an audience of 112.3 million viewers are cast as the judges of who will be the winners or losers in this 30-second game, played out in parallel with the sporting battle on the field. Instant thumbs up, thumbs down (on social media). Or that’s how the story goes.
Every four years, you find brands creating new grand narratives for the Olympics or the FIFA World Cup. Cross the Atlantic, and you find exactly the same dramatic narrative played out each year about department store Christmas TV ads. Which store has captured the nation’s heart this holiday with the most emotional 30-second story? It’s no coincidence that the UK department store chain, John Lewis, launched its first big Christmas advert in 2007 — the year that both Apple launched the iPhone and Netflix launched its subscription streaming services. It’s a year that marks the start of an historic shift in consumer behaviors: mobile, the app-ecosystem, streaming; the year when the means for content creation, sharing and consumption is suddenly in everyone’s pocket.
The truth about these big budget ads is both more complex, more planned, and more mundane than half-a-minute of high-drama. And it certainly takes more brand management.
It’s a campaign, not a 30-second blitz
Let’s take the example of this year’s Super Bowl ads. Long before the Rams or the Bengals took to the field of play on Feb 13 — or Dr Dre and Snoop and the legends of hip hop took center stage for the half-time show — Jeff Bezos teased Amazon’s Alexa Superbowl ad on Twitter. A full week before it aired during the game, you could watch how a mind-reading Alexa was wreaking havoc in the life of real-life couple Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost. It was just one example of how brands attempt to start the buzz long before game day.
Made for TV, but brands play omnichannel
The length of the big event ads fits the conventions of the traditional TV format. But that’s where they start to play to rules of their own. They are typically a story rather than a “sell” and more often than not feature celebrities if not on screen then at least as a voice (or as the soundtrack).
But from this starting point, the ads play out on every channel: omnichannel. The Christmas advert wars in the UK are fought across YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and last year TikTok … as well as in-store with collectibles, or book or music tie-ins. The 2021 John Lewis Christmas ad, “Unexpected Guest,” which told the story of a young alien landing in woods close to a boy’s home, included a variety of interactive elements. Through the John Lewis app and website, users could explore the world of the ad through the boy’s eyes and discover augmented reality characters and download printable activities. There was also behind the scenes footage. Two Snapchat lenses were created: one as an outward facing lens to let users experience the alien’s spaceship in the real world, the other a selfie lens to “become” the alien.
One piece split into many atoms
Sports brand Under Armour won accolades for a 2016 Olympics ad campaign that managed to grab attention without even mentioning the name of the world’s biggest sporting event (as it wasn’t a main sponsor, it was barred from mentioning the name or featuring the famous rings logo). Their “The Last Goodbye” ad showing the training regime of the most decorated Olympian of all-time, US swimmer Michael Phelps, was released five months before the Rio games. But it wasn’t just a TV commercial. The commercial played out across social media and included a video of Phelps himself watching the ad for the first time, and moved to tears by the experience.
In the same year, Belgian-style beer brand Shock Top became a first time Super Bowl advertiser back in 2016. Its ad, featuring T.J. Miller from the HBO series Silicon Valley, was the hero piece of content — but 90 separate pieces of content were spun from it and released in the month pre-and-post the game. This year, Pepsi’s promotion of its half-time show included a full-blown cinematic trailer for the first time. The trailer, The Call, was released a month before the game and has now clocked up more than 16 million views on YouTube. But it was just one atom in the universe of content Pepsi created around the halftime show.
Pulling off these coordinated, complex campaigns requires careful brand management
Pull those pieces together, and the story of a grand narrative TV commercial in the 2020s is going to take a lot of planning and prep as part of an omnichannel campaign. We’re talking dozens of pieces of content released over the course of a month. This presents brands with major challenges surrounding consistency and organization. To run a successful grand narrative TV commercial as the centerpiece of an omnichannel campaign, creative leaders need to coordinate mountains of interconnected content.
Digital asset management software like Canto makes that possible.
A single source of truth for your brand and campaign
A digital asset management system is a hub for all of a brand’s content. This single source of truth enables creative teams to manage version updates, link related campaign content, and track critical information like licensing and usage rights. Campaigns of this scale and complexity have a lot of people working on them – both in-house and externally – and a lot of moving parts. Having a central source of information that serves as a version of record and keeps everyone on-brand is essential.
Content controls and approval workflows ensure quality and consistency
Managing all the media content that goes into an omnichannel campaign from a central location keeps everyone on the same page – with approval workflows ensuring only the right content makes its way into an ad. Most importantly, working from a common content library enables geographically dispersed teams to work on separate elements in parallel, knowing they’ll eventually fit together to form a cohesive campaign.
Faster, easier workflows remove the hassle from the creative process
Digital asset management tools aren’t just about tracking content. They also make it easier to work with images, video, and other digital files to create and remix existing content in different formats and sizes – for YouTube, social media, and other channels. Shaving time off of every touchpoint with each of the hundreds of media components that go into a campaign enables content teams to create more content faster, without sacrificing campaign cohesion or brand conformity.
Brands that use technology like Canto to coordinate their content and manage their brands reclaim time and attention to invest in what every blockbuster TV ad and omnichannel campaign lives or dies by: creativity.

September 19, 2019|
Surfing Heritage and Culture Center announced the winner of their 2019 Follow the Light (FTL) photography contest in a beautiful awards ceremony in Dana Point, CA.
Before the awards ceremony, Canto hosted a sold-out VIP reception at the observatory deck of the Ocean Institute, a small aquarium on the harbour. We said cheers to the talented finalists and continued legacy of surf photography over freshly made palomas and sweeping ocean views.
Don Meek, chairman of the FTL contest committee, and Glenn Brumage, SHACC’s executive director, spoke about the challenges of bringing back the contest after its four-year hiatus. When SHACC took over the contest this year, they needed a technology partner to help them run it efficiently on a global scale.
“From the start, Canto has gone above and beyond to help us make Follow the Light a global contest,” said Don.
Jack Huber, Canto’s head of community, expressed how sponsoring the FTL contest aligns with Canto’s values.
“We are always looking to partner with organizations doing things we believe in. SHACC’s mission of empowering amateur photographers to get a jump start in their career – that’s right in line with everything we stand for. Canto exists to foster creative collaboration in an increasingly chaotic world, so teaming up with SHACC was a very natural partnership.” said Jack.
The awards ceremony opened with a tribute to Larry “Flame” Moore, the late photo editor of Surfing Magazine. The FTL contest is held in honor of Moore’s memory, because he mentored so many young photographers throughout his career. The five contest finalists presented their photos and had the opportunity to talk about their inspirations and personal journeys as photographers.
Nick Green from Tasmania, Australia, was announced as the winner. He spoke about how photography keeps him going through mental illness.
“Struggling with mental health was probably my biggest influence to take photos,” Nick said. “Put simply, photography gave me something to do, something to take my mind off things when they got dark, a creative outlet to express myself and immerse myself in the present moment, which at that point in my life I was really struggling with. Photography was the therapy that I didn’t know I needed.”
Nick’s photos have a dark and moody style that draws inspiration from his rugged, beautiful homeland of Tasmania. We can’t wait to see more from him, and with the awesome working opportunities he earned as part of FTL’s grand prize, we’re sure we will!
SHACC also announced the People’s Choice winner, Shane Grace, from Huntington Beach, CA. The other finalists are Paul Greene, Ryan Mack and Nolan Sullivan."

142,https://www.canto.com/blog/content-chaos-poll/,"New study: Marketing teams waste weeks every year searching for files
September 6, 2021|
Powerful images, memorable infographics, entertaining videos – content is an important pillar of digital marketing, and quite a lot of money and time goes into producing it. But just how much time do teams spend keeping track of that content? We wanted to know, so we conducted a survey.
In cooperation with the opinion research institute Civey, we asked more than 500 marketing experts what resources they spend searching for content and digital assets.
The results are in, and they are quite clear: far too many.
There’s some good news, though. The right tools make a difference. Good digital asset management solutions are an effective way to keep teams from wasting time and resources.
Searching for files is time-consuming
Imagine this scenario: The whole marketing team has been working on the new brochure for weeks. The only thing missing is that one product picture. Finding it on the server should be easy, shouldn’t it? Is it really saved to the server, though – or could it possibly be in the cloud? And where is that new video clip that we produced last month? Also, why are all the folders named like that? It’s like there’s no system at all.
Important assets might just disappear in an overly confusing and complex filing system. All of this makes the search for one specific file extremely difficult and time-consuming. Wanting to find out just how much time marketing teams spend searching for digital assets, we cooperated with the opinion research institute Civey to conduct a survey of marketing experts.
Teams spend three weeks a year just looking for files
Now the results are in, and they show that many marketing teams spend a lot of time searching for suitable content. Around a third (33.4%) of people working in marketing spend around three weeks per year searching for pictures, videos and other digital files. 15% of them spend up to six weeks a year (!) searching for content on disorganized servers and in the cloud.
Canto CEO Jack McGannon says: “The survey results are alarming. Brands are producing more content than ever before. When keeping track of all those digital assets becomes a drain on resources, companies aren’t seeing the returns on those investments they should expect.”
The survey also reveals what marketing experts have a clear idea of what they need to tackle the problem of disorganized digital media files: They want the right tools.
The solution: Intelligent tools
Many marketing experts count on digital solutions and artificial intelligence to make their jobs easier. More than half (55%) of the marketers we surveyed said that better tools would make their content management and performance more efficient.
“Many companies experience digital chaos. It seems almost unbelievable that staff is spending so much time and energy on searching for files. We want to make it possible for them to spend more time on their creative and strategic work,” says Jack McGannon.
Marketing professionals who know that they need better tools have already taken the first step. The next step is to find the right one. Canto’s digital asset management (DAM) solution has helped thousands of teams take control of their media libraries. While Canto offers a central location for all types of files, it’s so much more than just a media library. Thanks to tags, keywords and metadata, Canto is fully searchable, meaning teams no longer need to dig through messy folders to find what they need. And intelligent features such as automatic face recognition make search even easier.
That’s the good news for teams struggling with digital asset management. It’s definitely possible to control the flood of content – all you need is the right tool.
About the study
Canto commissioned the opinion research institute Civey to survey 500 marketing professionals. All participants were questioned between March 22, 2021 and April 9, 2021. The results are representative. The statistical error of the overall results is about 8%. The survey was carried out online. All participants supplied their personal data, such as age, sex and place of residence, and they were all registered and verified. Civey uses a multilevel weighting procedure to correct any distortion. More information about the method on civey.com."

September 26, 2019|
Large enterprises use content lifecycle management systems for content creation within projects. Learn the basics of when and how to utilize a content lifecycle management tool.
What is content lifecycle management?
Content lifecycle is the process any piece of digital content undergoes throughout its existence. It is the beginning, middle and end of data creation. Content lifecycle is dynamic and looks vastly different from one piece of content to the next. It’s usually managed with content lifecycle software.
Just like a living thing, content moves through different cycles of life depending on the type of content it is. Certain content will be instructed to undertake different forms and constructions, making lifecycles numerous and overwhelming for businesses to oversee. The best way to understand content lifecycle is to visualize content as a concrete object, for example a drawing of a logo. This drawing undergoes a lifecycle similarly to any living creature – it has a beginning, middle and end.
Content lifecycle administration
Content lifecycle management (CLM) is the administration of an organization’s content creation. It’s the coordinating of how a project will happen. After overseeing initial phases of content ideas, CLM tackles the development of the content. Because of the numerous members creating content within an enterprise, executive oversight is a necessary part of CLM.
As the lifecycle progresses past the creation phase, CLM prepares it to be introduced to the public as a completed product. The management doesn’t end there though, as now the upkeep of the content begins. The content may eventually be deleted at some point, ending the cycle of a particular piece of content. CLM goes along for the entire ride of a piece of content’s lifecycle.
When is content lifecycle management necessary?
For smaller companies with minimal mediums of content creation, CLM might not be that important. However, evolving companies utilizing the plethora of content platforms find keeping control over the entirety of their content an impossible task. As companies grow and begin creating content on things like social media, blogs and other formats, the need for CLM grows exponentially. When administrators can no longer keep track of the entire content lifecycle of a business, it is officially time for a business to use a CLM system.
Benefits of content lifecycle management
CLM saves time and resources, allowing administrators to focus on tasks other than overseeing processes in the content lifecycle. This increases efficiency and productivity, enhancing creative development within projects and campaigns. It gives a clear rundown of the different processes a content within a campaign undergoes. An underrated aspect of a CLM system is the concrete data and evidence it gives admins concerning production of its teams and performance of individual team members.
CLM systems inevitably have to mesh with other tools and business necessities. One such necessity is brand management, which keeps finished projects up to brand code. Keep this in mind when researching potential CLM software.
Ideal features of CLM software
When considering which CLM to implement, ensure it has important features to integrate it into your daily operations. It should work alongside everyday functionality of a business, easing the pressure off administrators in charge of content creation. It should handle the analytics of content lifecycle processes. This ensures that everything important is processed immediately for decisions to be made concerning changes of creation, employees and other factors.
Utilizing a CLM system is a big choice for an organization, one that requires deep understanding of different aspects of content lifecycle. Examine the benefits and nuances of CLM tools to help your company excel in handling all forms of creative content."
144,https://www.canto.com/blog/content-management-benefits/,"Your marketing team needs a content management solution. Here’s why.
January 26, 2023|
You know that feeling when you can’t find your car keys and spend 20 minutes tearing apart your house, only to find them in your pocket? It’s frustrating, right? Well, imagine losing track of digital assets like images and videos. Only not every asset is as easy to locate as your keys. It’s a major headache (trust us, we know from experience). That’s why your team needs a digital asset management (DAM) platform as part of its marketing tech stack.
If you’re a member of a marketing team (or you are the whole marketing team!), you know that your team’s digital assets are essential. But you might not realize that they need to be managed just like any other asset. Otherwise, they can quickly become disorganized and difficult to track across multiple platforms. That’s where the DAM content management system comes in. It’s a way to keep your digital assets organized and easy to find. Plus, it can save your team time and money in the long run. If you’re looking for a way to improve your team’s workflow, consider adding digital asset management to your marketing tech stack’s arsenal of tools.
Your content management strategy is incomplete without a DAM
A digital asset management (DAM) system is essential if you want your marketing tech stack to be state-of-the-art. Powerful DAM content management tools help you store, curate, protect, and share important materials in one place — product photos, videos, logos, documents, and more. Having everything organized in one central location makes finding and using those assets easier and faster. You can then focus on producing the best content instead of searching through countless folders trying to find what you need. And let’s face it: nobody’s got time for that!
Modern DAM solutions also give marketing teams control and visibility into their content management. Security options ensure that only approved users have access to the content, so your marketing materials are always in safe hands. Additionally, you can keep track of who is using an asset, when it’s being used, and where it’s being shared — perfect for marketing teams that need to stay compliant and optimize the way they work.
Why your team needs a DAM
Since marketing teams have become more decentralized over the years, the need for a comprehensive DAM solution has never been greater. An asset management platform helps you better manage content and increases operational efficiency by making it easier to work with assets and collaborate with colleagues across the globe. Not only does it help manage content in one central hub, but it also provides visibility and access rights to the content, so users are accessing the right material at the right time. That means marketing teams can spend less time searching for files and more time focusing on marketing campaigns that will really move the needle for your business.
The best part? You don’t even have to be in the same location to access files and make updates. Not only does a DAM allow you to access files from anywhere, but it also helps you quickly find what you need using keywords, tags, and other metadata. Even better, you can automate repetitive tasks like sorting images based on content or resizing them for specific use cases (such as social media posts or feature images) to save time and energy.
Running a successful project with content spread out across multiple channels can be a daunting task, but with a DAM, marketing teams can share assets quickly and securely to streamline content workflows. And you’ll be able to track changes made over time so you can keep content up-to-date and accurate. It’s the perfect solution for busy teams looking to make content management easier.
How a DAM can change your marketing team
The right content management strategy can significantly improve your marketing team’s workflow and change how work gets done. A digital asset management system streamlines the process of locating, sharing, and utilizing photos, videos, and other digital elements across teams, which makes life easier for everyone using those assets to create engaging marketing content.
From organizing assets with easy-to-navigate libraries to creating more efficient workflows that eliminate extra steps in asset tracking and approval, DAM tools have all the capabilities necessary to produce marketing campaigns quickly and effectively. Content management solutions make marketing teams more productive, efficient, and organized with features like version control, file sharing, activity logs, metadata tagging, and more. It’s also a great way to future-proof your marketing programs to ensure long-term flexibility!
10 ways DAM enhances your content management
- Improved organization: Digital asset management tools help marketing teams organize content in one centralized location. Consolidating assets is especially helpful for teams that utilize multiple storage platforms, creating a single source of truth for all marketing content.
- Streamlined search capabilities: With a DAM, marketing teams can search for assets quickly using keywords, tags, and other metadata. DAM platforms save time and make finding the content you need right when you need it much more manageable.
- Automated tasks: Marketing teams can save time and energy by automating some tedious content-related tasks, such as manually resizing images or clunky review processes via email.
- Brand consistency: With a DAM platform, marketing teams can centralize their brand guidelines. Having the brand guidelines easily accessible by all teams ensures that all content is consistent with the company’s core values and brand identity and marketing campaigns have a unified look and feel.
- Increased collaboration: Digital asset management tools make it easier for marketing teams to collaborate on initiatives, improving productivity and boosting overall marketing efforts.
- Increased efficiency: DAM content management software enables marketing teams to streamline their processes, allowing for the launch of campaigns quickly and more efficiently.
- Fewer errors: By providing marketing teams with better organization, search capabilities, and visibility into their content, campaigns become more accurate and effective.
- Better scalability: Digital asset management tools can be easily scaled up or down depending on the needs of the marketing teams, allowing teams to adjust their workflows and campaigns as needed.
- Software integrations: DAM content management solutions can easily integrate with many different types of software you likely already have in your tech stack. Most DAMs integrate with marketing automation platforms (like MailChimp), creative tools (like Canva), and content marketing systems (like WordPress), to name a few. These tools help marketing teams create the perfect marketing tech stack to maximize their efforts.
- ROI tracking: A robust DAM platform enables the team to easily track campaigns’ return on investment (ROI). DAM analytics help marketing teams optimize their strategies, measure performance, and make data-driven decisions.
Before you buy a DAM
Building a marketing tech stack with a digital asset management system at the core is like setting up the foundation of your home. If you don’t build a strong base, you’ll likely have to go back and repair the weak spots later. But don’t worry, getting started with DAM isn’t scary – you’ll soon discover how it can help your marketing team increase creative efficiency and productivity to deliver delightful customer experiences. And, once you’ve got your DAM set up, plenty of marketing solutions you are already using integrate seamlessly to take your marketing effectiveness to new heights! Let’s run through what you’ll need to do to get started and how you can get the most out of the DAM you select.
1. Secure buy-in
If you want your DAM implementation to be successful, you’ll need to ensure you’ve got the support and buy-in from the entire team – after all, they are the ones that’ll use the new system. Focus on the individual benefits as much as possible and address any concerns the team might have immediately to put them at ease. Be sure to consult your stakeholders throughout the deployment process. By bringing their insight and ideas into play, you can empower them and create a culture in which everyone owns the project and its outcome.
2. Audit your marketing tech stack and digital assets
A comprehensive audit of existing digital tools and assets can help you maximize the impact of DAM software. While every organization has different needs and uses for its assets, looking into which tools are already in place gives excellent insight into where there’s room for improvement. That said, the shift from working with disparate file types and platforms – many of which don’t lend themselves well to collaboration – is only part of the picture. Implementing a more suitable asset management platform also helps improve processes and workflow in other areas, such as content creation and distribution. Besides, conducting an audit is beneficial on multiple fronts and could ultimately pay off big dividends if done correctly.
3. Establish DAM use guidelines
A DAM content management system should run like a well-oiled machine, ensuring communications run smoothly between teams and allowing for easy access to content. The platforms that excel in user accessibility and intuitive navigation are the ones that will make the content creation process simpler and more effective. Setting up clear guidelines is essential to creating a reliable DAM system so your team can quickly understand how everything should work. This will help your team locate, share, and repurpose your best content efficiently without enduring long delays at every step. Ultimately, delving into key specifics of using the platform at the start leads to well-crafted, practical asset management practices that get results every time.

October 6, 2019|
Content marketing is integral to the strategy of marketing departments. It’s the center of lead generation activities and informs marketing decisions. What should you expect from this vital component this year? Here are five 2019 content marketing trends to boost your campaigns.
Intrinsically profitable content marketing is booming
The Guinness Book of Work Records is a profitable content marketing campaign and is independent of the beer brand of the same name. Branded content in other organizations have the potential to be profitable and this is increasing with the advent of company blogs and YouTube channels.
Many brands have brought this into fruition. For example, the SEO tool, MOZ. MOZ’s content marketing is profitable independently of its core product. Its blog is a traffic-generating machine and the YouTube channel has 36k+ followers. With this content marketing success, MOZ could afford to ditch its tool, focus on content campaigns and turn a profit.
What will change in 2019 is how brands approach their content marketing efforts. Companies will have profitability as the primary focus of their campaigns. Organizations learned that intrinsically profitable content marketing efforts are optimal for achieving business goals. Furthermore, it doesn’t hurt the bottom line when a campaign turns a profit.
Converged media is the new media
Do you separate your content campaigns into paid, owned and earned media? If you don’t, 2019 is the year to change to a converged media strategy. The idea of converged media isn’t new but 2019 is ushering in a new era of converged media with content marketing centering on those efforts.
Brands are creating content marketing campaigns that work across all mediums. Traditional ad campaigns lack the efficiency of newer relevant content marketing campaigns. Rather than creating multiple pieces, brands are working within the same content marketing framework for their ads and original content.
What will be important for marketing professionals in 2019 is mastering the art of creating content that works across all media – paid, owned and earned. For instance, a video that works on a company YouTube channel amplifies when influencers share it. However, this only works if the video is converged-media optimized. Therefore, it’s a good idea to incorporate video asset management into the content creation process to streamline projects.
Increase in content marketing budgets revamps the creation process
If you thought 2018 was the peak year for the content explosion, think again. 2019 will be yet another record year for collateral creation. That means the content marketing budget for marketers will increase. This necessitates a shift in strategy for how that content budget is spent.
The increase in content doesn’t mean companies will pump out more material. Volume will increase but what’s prescient is quality improvement. Companies will start investing in effective creatives and – more importantly – better creative operations management.
Creative collaboration is vital for content marketing which captures the imagination of your audience. It’s also important for conversions. This is achieved with responsive, quality creative teamwork. In 2019, creative operations management will be in the budgets of many marketing departments.
Marketing departments are becoming trusted news organizations
Traditional media organizations, such as online publishers, have shifted from display ads to content marketing to pay the bills. Ad blockers, content overload and the ineffectiveness of banner ads have driven this trend. That means editorial and marketing departments have become more intertwined than in the past. The reverse is happening within marketing departments where quality journalism is working into content marketing.
2019 will see a shift in how content marketing efforts are perceived by their audience – particularly the journalistic quality. Plenty of content marketing has high-quality content standards. With the myriad brand-neutral campaigns out there, many company blogs and YouTube channels are becoming trusted sources of news.
A great example is the OPEN Forum online publication from credit card company American Express. The campaign idea was to provide insights and inspiration to small businesses and start-ups – the target audience of American Express’ business credit card line. Now it’s a robust and trusted publication for business strategy news and analysis.
Marketing tools produce content in conjunction with AI
If you think you’re not using artificial intelligence in your content marketing, think again. Over 100 marketing tools are already AI-enhanced and it’s expected that nearly all martech will have AI capabilities in 2019. That means you’ll be working alongside AI in your content marketing campaigns.
What matters for 2019 is how marketing departments adapt to using AI in their campaigns. Contrary to naysayers, AI can be a source of creativity. Many AI features save time on manual work so you can focus on more creative endeavors.
Image recognition and auto-tagging for images in digital asset management are great examples. Instead of manually inputting tags on pictures (so you can later find them), images are tagged automatically giving you the freedom to find more creative ways to connect with your target audience.
Capitalize on these 2019 content marketing trends
Take these insights for the coming year and use them to drive the success of your organization’s content marketing campaigns. Stay ahead of the trends and be a trendsetter."

March 2, 2020|
More doesn’t always mean better. This has never been more true than with digital content today. Upon first glance, it seems great that there’s so much potential content to consume. However, as you experience the massive content wealth daily, it becomes clear that it’s not as helpful as it should be.
Fortunately, with a little creativity and outside-the-box thinking, you can create content that defies stagnation. Essentially, it’s possible to build an abundance of material that reaches audiences and overcomes the content overload that dwarfs so many other new articles. Here’s how.
The unfortunate reality of content overload
The most important thing in transforming your marketing projects and campaigns to deliver content that stands out among others is understanding the concept of content overload. By learning and fully grasping it, we can figure out ways to defeat it.
Content overload is when too many different blog posts, articles, ideas and suggestions cover one specific area. This has a couple negative effects. For one, it creates a vast quantity of material concerning a topic, making it hard for anyone to stand out. Another problem is it turns off the potential audience, as they don’t want to sift through endless content to find a piece they like.
So what are some ways we can stand out?
Create real connections with the audience
The first thing to understand is that our potential audience has adapted to content overload. Similarly, we need to adapt to this reality and reach them in a whole new way. Making ‘safe’ articles that have shown mediocre results in the past is just fueling the already blazing content overload fire. It’s time to turn this new reality on its head and use it to our advantage.
Let’s begin with a new, direct focus on our potential audience. This focus needs to extend deeper and further than normal – as everyone already mostly focuses on their potential audience. Instead, we need to build an honest connection with whoever reads our content. They should feel as if they’re reading a piece that was written by someone just like them with similar interests and ideas.
This is going to take a lot of research, hard work and creativity. There’s a huge difference between genuinely connecting with readers and pandering to them. More importantly, our readers are going to sniff it out immediately.
Discover new ways to overcome content overload
The reality of beating content overload is that not everyone has all the answers and solutions. While there are some examples of success to follow, there are still plenty of undiscovered ways to go about this. Similar to creating new and exciting content that differentiates from the field, also look for different strategies that could help your content stand out. The reason some pieces stood out from the crowd to begin with was they were developed using a brand new strategy that no one had tried before. This type of innovation is the key to overcoming content overload.
That all being said, there are still some fantastic suggestions and ideas that could get you over the top. You absolutely should implement these established methods in order to boost overall content success. However, it’s important to look for ways to differentiate your methodology as well, whether it’s through structures, specific content styles or even aesthetics.
The future of digital content
A tipping point has already been reached with digital content. There are no longer untapped content resources and keywords waiting to be written about. This is the reality of our current situation. The only thing to do now is adapt. Instead of focusing on how we’ll break onto the scene of a new and exciting idea, we should rather focus on our competition and audience, working to separate ourselves from our peers in the eyes of our readers.
Another thing to monitor and form strategies for is how we will go about creating content when new technology and other ideas sprout up. This happens at a much slower pace now than years ago, since the important tech we use is much more established now. However, it does happen and we need to successfully stand out when creating pieces about it when it does.
So where do we go from here? Make sure to evaluate your content periodically. See how it’s performing and determine why it’s doing so in that manner. Detailed analysis and tech tools are your friend when trying to break free from the cycle of content overload. As long as you’re thinking about differentiating from the competition rather than falling in line and playing it safe, you’re bound to succeed.
To further your control over digital content, consider implementing a digital asset management system."

September 15, 2022|
What is a content refresh?
A content refresh is the addition of new copy, branding, assets, or other SEO-related activities in order to make content more relevant, on-brand, or fulfill new marketing campaign initiatives. Marketing teams may decide to refresh content when it is no longer performing as expected on their site, in email campaigns, or through organic and direct traffic.
As content ages, content decay — the process of content becoming inaccurate (or less accurate) —sets in. Even evergreen content cannot stay on-brand and relevant forever and requires refresh over time.
It is important to update or refresh content in order to:
- Own specific core business keywords on organic search in order to keep or gain market share from competitors.
- Increase brand equity and trust by creating an on-brand content journey across all channels, no matter where a visitor or customer may interact with your brand.
- Improve conversion metrics for marketing campaigns and other specific tactics.
- Include new products, integrations, or features in existing assets.
Marketing teams may choose to perform a content refresh periodically, such as on an annual basis or during a content audit. Branding initiatives, marketing campaign requirements, and search engine optimization tactics should drive how often you look to refresh content that is in decay, among other factors.
But how do you know where to start in your content refresh journey?
Laying the foundation for a content refresh
Before you get started on refreshing content, you should lay some groundwork for your marketing planning (if you haven’t already). These two foundational steps assuredly will make the tips below easy to execute.
Perform a Content Audit
A content audit is the process of cataloging or indexing your content into an easy-to-digest format. What content is performing well? What’s out of date? Is anything off-brand? Performing a content audit will help your team understand where they stand today in terms of content resources at your disposal (and what is missing).
Using a digital asset management platform makes content audits easier, because all your brand’s content is already in one place.
Use a Content Strategy
A content strategy guides the tactical direction of your marketing team’s initiatives and should be central to your marketing arsenal. In your marketing strategy, your team should define:
- Which audiences, verticals, or markets are key to your business to target.
- What personas your organization should be targeting.
- What content is the most important to create or refresh.
Think of your content strategy as the tactical activities your marketing department is taking to achieve your organization’s vision.
Once you have those two pieces in place, you can easily transition to these 8 tips to refresh content quickly.
8 ways to perform a content refresh today
There are ways your marketing team can refresh content to make an impact in a short time. Let’s look at 8 fireproof, easy ways you can get started on a content refresh today.
1. How to handle rebranding
Many organizations will go through a rebranding process at some point, which can cause content decay to set in and make even the most important and high-performing assets off-brand quickly. Even brands that don’t choose to rebrand will evolve over time and require rebranding at some point. Finding quick ways to catalog off-brand assets and refresh them using new color palettes, logos, typography, and on-brand copy is key.
Pro Tip: Tools such as Canva, which integrates directly with your Canto Library, enable your team to add new color gradients and on-brand assets quickly. Using Adobe InDesign? Canto integrates with that too.
2. Scale content while keeping your brand voice
Brand guidelines dictate your brand’s visual and verbal style, such as color palettes and typography (which we briefly discussed above). Basically, your brand guidelines communicate who your brand is to the world. And part of your identity is your brand voice, which is the distinct sound and personality your brand chooses to use in your messaging.
Invariably, many brands utilize multiple team members or collaborate with creative agencies and freelancers, which makes keeping your tone and voice on-brand extremely difficult as you scale content efforts. The way to ensure that everything stays on-brand with consistent messaging and look across channels? Branding guidelines, of course!
Pro Tip: You need to have brand guidelines established, communicated, and in a location that is easy to find. With Canto, you can create, edit, store, and distribute your brand guidelines easily and securely to internal and external teams.
3. Add new products or integrations
As your organization grows, your product line will change, gain integrations and extensions, and include add-ons for customers. And while the long-term goal should always be to refresh content to include your new products in relevant one pagers, guides, eBooks, and other relevant sales collateral (using your content audit to guide these efforts), that will take time.
In the meantime, shorter term updates can make a big impact too.
Create custom product banners in appropriates sizes (on-brand, of course) and sprinkle those banners throughout your marketing campaigns and assets. Consider using banners:
- As in-line call-to-actions within relevant blog posts.
- Within customer newsletters to increase upsells.
- Within nurture sequences to raise awareness of new products and integrations.
- Within sales outreach sequences or on sales email signatures.
This way, you don’t need to perform a full content refresh immediately in order to increase product page traffic and visibility upon launch. That’s called scaling content on a budget.
4. Refresh page metadata
Optimizing metadata, which is the data used to organize other data to be more meaningful, can be one of the easiest and fastest ways to improve site content such as older blog posts. Consider the following hierarchy for SEO refresh:
- Meta titles (also known as title tags or SEO titles) should be first to refresh. These are the first things that should be optimized for search engines. Try including your primary keyword, actionable word choices to entice clicks, and your brand name included at the end of the tag.
- Meta descriptions should include both primary and secondary keywords. Ensure you capture the intent of the article in your copy while staying on-brand and relevant.
- Headlines should also include your primary keyword and secondary keywords if possible, and can be similar to the title tag if you choose.
Pro Tip: Try optimizing using one tactic at a time and then measuring results, otherwise you won’t uncover which tactic led to an increase or decrease in traffic or ranking.
5. Add new copy
All assets have a shelf life, even evergreen content. Eventually, you will need to refresh the copy of your landing pages, blog posts, and long-form content as your brand, products, audiences, or business focus shifts. Use a content audit to know which content is performing best and which is in dire need of improvement from decay.
Try the following as you look at what copy you need to add to aging content to improve shelf life:
- Focus on ensuring the new and refreshed copy is on-brand and industry-relevant as you look to showcase your brand as a thought leader in a specific space or topic.
- Ensure your blogs that are not performing on search get the keyword research they need in order to refocus on the right primary and supporting keywords that are relevant today.
Pro Tip: Try combining steps four and five for the best SEO results on blogs, landing pages, pillar pages, and even product pages.
6. Include relevant interlinks
Add interlinks (links to other important pages on your site) onto landing pages in campaigns, eBooks, and more in order to allow search engines to crawl your site more extensively. For example, as you publish an eBook on a specific topic, you can find all related content on that subject and add links within that content to the new eBook. Think of this as building a spider web that connects your pages together.
Pro Tip: Anchor text, or the text your hyperlink rests upon, should be on contextually-relevant copy as related to the destination link.
7. Augment content with new formats
For content that is stunning and performs well on search or CTR (or at least decently), consider adding or embedding new types of content into the original content medium, such as videos or infographics. New mediums will help audiences digest the content in new and meaningful ways and engage with visitors that are more inclined to skim your content for the most important tidbits.
8. Retarget content for new audiences
Retargeting content, or taking existing content and slightly changing to fit for a new but similar audience/persona, is the easiest way to enter new markets and verticals. Creating a brand-new library of content around a specific vertical is a large lift and may not work with your budget requirements. But retailoring existing eBooks with new images and slight copy modifications? That’s a no brainer.
Pro Tip: With Canto’s version control, you can choose to keep all your eBook versions together vertically stacked or separate them out as different files entirely. Your choice.
Digital asset management makes refreshing content easier
Having a digital asset management platform at your disposal makes refreshing your old content easier than ever before. With all your content in one place as a single source of truth, content auditing and strategy becomes a cinch. You can focus your team’s efforts on refreshing your content to be on-brand, tailored to the audiences you desire, and performing better than ever before.

December 15, 2022|
Today’s marketing teams are under pressure to produce more content at a faster pace without sacrificing quality. Maybe you’re looking to promote your latest products and services over paid media channels. Or perhaps you’re providing advice and data-driven insights through downloadable resources. Whatever your marketing goals, leveraging your digital assets to create that content requires careful coordination and proven processes. With the right foundation in place, you’ll be able to create content at scale effectively to keep customers engaged and take advantage of new opportunities.
What are digital assets and what is digital asset management?
When it comes to sharing your content, you may have heard the words “digital assets” get thrown around a lot recently. However, digital asset management has been around for nearly 30 years – but what are considered digital assets? And what does managing them look like?
First of all, digital assets constitute nearly every piece of content your team produces – from social media banners to videos and everything in between. Digital asset management – or DAM – is the single source of truth where all of your files and content can be stored, easily accessed, and searched for by anyone in your organization with access.
When you’re getting ready to scale your content, having something like a digital asset management tool in place is imperative to your success.
What does it mean to scale content?
Scaling content is the process of producing high-quality digital assets in a timely, streamlined fashion. Your content can vary from things like blogs and case studies to social media posts and video projects. The overall goal of scaling content production is to maintain quality and brand relevance while making sure clients and stakeholders stay consistently engaged. This can be an ambitious undertaking, but with these ten tips, you’ll be able to build the foundation you need to scale your content – and do it right the first time.
10 Tips for Scaling Content Production Effectively
1. Set measurable goals
Every piece of content you produce and distribute should contribute toward a specific goal. Without measurable goals to tell you how well your content scaling strategy is doing, you can end up wasting valuable time and resources creating material that doesn’t produce meaningful results. By setting goals like boosting engagement, improving lead conversion, or generating sales, you’ll be able to assess whether the content you’re creating is having an impact on your business.
2. Conduct a content audit
If your organization is struggling to figure out which digital assets are worth keeping and reusing, conducting a thorough audit of content resources is a great solution. An audit helps maximize the value of digital assets by ensuring that nothing slips through the cracks and goes unused after investing resources to create it. Be sure to assess how well your published content is performing as well. Even the most successful campaigns can grow stale after a while, so including performance metrics in your audit can help you identify opportunities for a content refresh.
3. Build a content calendar
Content calendars map out a schedule of what content is being created, who is working on it, and which audience it should reach. They’re valuable for scaling your content strategy because they eliminate confusion over how resources are being utilized, so your digital team can be more productive. Your content calendar should be made available to everyone involved in the production process to keep the creative team on the same page, and can be built using project management looks like the ones mentioned below (check out tip #7).
4. Identify reusable assets
If you don’t know what content you already have, it’s going to be hard to decide what you can reuse! Labeling assets suitable for reuse, or storing them in a dedicated location, makes it easy to distinguish them from unique, single-use assets or content that has usage rights restrictions. You can use reporting tools to identify content that has performed well in the past, so you can deploy them again and review them to understand why they worked so well the first time. Identifying reusable content also streamlines the approval process since the assets were already approved for use once.
5. Look for recycling opportunities
You can get more value out of your content by proactively identifying opportunities to recycle assets. Whether it’s plucking key facts from a whitepaper to create an infographic or incorporating webinar video footage into social media posts, planning to repurpose content before it’s even created can help you think expansively about the ways you utilize assets.
6. Create brand guidelines
Establishing brand guidelines is a good way to maintain consistency. They show how to present your brand’s content in a variety of situations. The brand guidelines should include your organization’s story, values, and overall voice, as well as approved elements like colors, fonts, and icons. If you’re going to be working with external collaborators, brand guidelines can help you ensure that brand content will be consistent no matter who is working on it. Canto DAM features a dedicated location for storing and distributing brand guidelines to support creative teams.
7. Use project management tools
Since every member of a team is responsible for different tasks, using a project management tool, like Wrike or Workfront, can help keep everyone on the right track. The priority level of each task can be easily displayed within the project management tool, showing each team member the order in which the tasks need to be completed. In addition to storing and sharing content, having a universal place for graphic designers, copywriters, and marketers to create content helps to streamline the creative process even further. Content creation software lets team members embrace a creative operations mindset that helps them build and collaborate on brand-new content.
8. Take advantage of digital asset management
Utilizing digital asset management (DAM) software should be at the heart of any marketing tech stack. A DAM platform like Canto provides a central location for all digital assets like photos, videos, graphics, documents, and much more. This allows a creative team to easily locate these assets from anywhere, which eliminates any slowdown caused by lost or missing assets. Since team members are working from the same content library, they can also collaborate more effectively using shared workspaces.
9. Label assets with metadata
If you can’t find the assets you need when you need them, they might as well not exist! You also don’t want to waste time searching through multiple content libraries in search of the right asset. Labeling your assets with easily searchable tags, keywords, and other metadata (including photo metadata) helps you avoid the time-consuming task of sifting multiple folders and storage locations in search of the right file. Organizing and labeling assets also make it much easier for external collaborators, vendors, and partners to quickly find what they’re looking for without needing to ask for help.
10. Optimize workflows & content distribution
Once you have the right technology in place for organizing your digital assets, you’ll also want to establish streamlined content workflows that help your team produce creative projects at scale. When everyone knows what tasks they’re responsible for, where to access resources, and how projects should move from one production stage to the next, you can keep your creative process moving quickly and efficiently. Content distribution should also be optimized to avoid bottlenecks and ensure that your assets are always in the right hands at the right time.
Let Canto set you up for success
As a top-notch digital asset management platform, Canto helps businesses with content scaling by becoming an interconnected content hub for every tool in your tech stack. Organize images, videos, brand elements, and more with Canto’s powerful, AI-driven tagging and metadata tools, so your team can quickly find the assets they need and keep your creative workflows moving efficiently. Canto also integrates seamlessly into leading project management and storage platforms to streamline content creation and help you manage access from a single source.

April 22, 2020|
Converting from an AI to an INDD is not the most common task. Chances are you’ll hardly ever encounter a need to make this change. However, just in case it happens, here’s a guide to make sure you know how. We’ll start by explaining both of these file types so that you have a base understanding of each.
What is the AI image file?
The AI image file is the standard graphic format used for files saved from the popular image design tool Adobe Illustrator. It uses vector graphics, which create the outcome of a picture by connecting numerous digital points that instruct what kind of graphic to display in that area. The AI is used extensively by large enterprises due to its resizable qualities and ability to function as a brand logo graphic.
What is an INDD image file?
The InDesign file extension (INDD) is the official file extension for projects created using the software system Adobe InDesign. An INDD file contains many different elements, like layouts and page data. Because of its print features, the INDD is often used to create newspapers, detailed print layouts, newsletters and flyers.
Now that you see these two popular file extensions’s true purpose, let’s dive into how to convert from one to the other.
How to convert the AI to INDD?
Although converting from the AI to the INDD doesn’t really work per se, there is in fact a roundabout way to make it happen. You will need access to both the Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign software programs. First, make sure whoever you’re converting to INDD for understands what will happen when making this change. This is much different from converting more accessible file types.
If you or the eventual recipient is sure about the necessity to have the file in the INDD format, begin the procedure by launching Adobe Illustrator. Next, open the AI file you wish to convert. Copy the image (using the ‘copy’ feature). Then, launch Adobe InDesign. Paste your image (using the ‘paste’ feature) into InDesign and save the project. You now have that AI image as an INDD.
What are the benefits?
Since this is such a rare conversion, the benefits will be very case-by-case. The first potential benefit is that now the image file will likely be more agreeable with most printers. InDesign is a very print-based project creator, so this would make sense. Though this is one possible benefit, it’s still going to be rare for a user to request you move an AI file into an INDD.
Another reason to convert is because you’re more comfortable working with an image when it’s in a more familiar tool. If you have extensive experience with InDesign, it would be logical to want a lot of your images in that system for editing and layouts. Even though converting from AI to INDD might not benefit you directly, it’s possible that another team member requests the INDD format and you’re able to give it to them by using this conversion method. It can’t hurt to be prepared.
Ultimately, this conversion won’t need to take place all that often. It is important, however, to be prepared just in case it does. Practice saving the AI into an INDD project to make sure you know how to do it."

December 13, 2019|
The AI file extension is tied to the Illustrator software. However, not everyone has access to Illustrator. When this is the case, it makes sense to change to a different file format. Converting an AI to JPG is necessary when sharing or sending image files to outside sources. Learn how to perform this conversion and the benefits of doing so. Here’s a comprehensive guide.
What is an AI?
The AI image file is an Adobe Illustrator file extension that is used by companies due to its scalability. It uses the rare graphic type, vector, which connects points in order to create images. With AI, users are able to resize images without losing any original resolution. Companies typically use AI when making graphics for logos.
What is a JPG?
The JPG is a lossy compression file extension. Lossy compression is a file type that can be shrunk in size without losing any of its original resolution. The JPG is interchangeable with the JPEG, since they’re both the standard format of the Joint Photographic Experts Group. Companies typically use the JPG when they want to edit an image file.
How to convert AI to JPG using Windows
- Open the intended AI file using Adobe Illustrator
- Select the portion of the file you wish to use
- Click ‘File’ then click ‘Export’ from the dropdown menu
- A save window will open. Choose the location you wish to save your file to.
- Type the name you wish to give the file (recommended that you do not save it the same name as your original AI file – for confusion’s sake)
- Click the ‘Save as type’ dropdown menu option, then select ‘JPG’ or ‘JPEG’
- Click the ‘save’ button
How to convert AI to JPG using Mac
- Open the intended AI file using Adobe Illustrator
- Select the portion of the file you wish to use
- Click ‘File’ then ‘Export’
- In the opened save window, choose the location and filename for your file
- Select a format (JPG or JPEG) from the ‘format’ popup window
- Click ‘export’
The standard option of conversion for most users is the above methods, as it’s directly from the source and is the easiest way to convert. However, sometimes a user will come across an AI file and they will not have access to Adobe Illustrator. In this case, many online conversion systems are available. They often require an upload or download process and in some cases ask for an e-mail address.
Why convert AI to JPG?
There are plenty of reasons one might need to convert an AI to a JPG. The AI image file is specific to Adobe Illustrator and not everyone uses Adobe. The decision to convert to a JPG image file would likely satisfy a lot of people if your intention was to share the file with others. They would then be able to open it with Windows or Mac.
It may also be a matter of space. The average AI file is very large and space-consuming, whereas the average JPG file is about 70 percent smaller. This has negative effects on both hard drive space due to the time it takes to send the file to a third party. A smaller image file also helps websites with images create faster load times, which is a huge benefit in terms of keeping customers satisfied on their site.
Other factors to consider
A JPG is a smaller, more widely-used image format but it has significantly fewer editing options than an AI. Be certain you’re finished with your entire editing process before making the decision to move the file from an AI to a JPG. Furthermore, the AI isn’t always the best choice in terms of editing. It typically gives users the chance to work with more tools, though sometimes it’s size is an issue to older systems.
If you’re trying to convert a JPG back into an AI, there are numerous tools available online to search for. Most of them are able to give a quick conversion based upon the upload and download speed of your internet service. A browser-based system, for example, gives users a chance to quickly convert without a lot of steps.
Chances are the JPG file created from the AI will be more accessible to the average user. Keep this in mind when considering options for conversion."

The AI image file is the official format for the design tool Adobe Illustrator. It is a scalable extension that uses vector graphics, a very rare computer image type. Vector graphics build image representation by connecting different points that indicate what type of image to display. The AI is resizable without any loss of image quality. The AI is usually ideal for companies because of how well it builds brand logos.
What is a PNG image file?
The PNG image file is a Portable Networks Graphics extension that is high in resolution and accessibility. The PNG is a raster image, meaning it creates image representations based on divided sections of a photo. Each division is used to specify which color shade goes where. This makes the PNG construct itself piece-by-piece. The PNG, like the AI, is lossless compression, meaning it retains quality as the size reduces.
How to convert the AI to the PNG
There are fortunately a lot of different methods to convert the AI to a PNG. The first and most natural method is a manual conversion using the Adobe Illustrator software program. If you don’t have access to Adobe Illustrator, don’t worry, we will give alternatives as well. To make this conversion, first open the AI file you wish to change in Illustrator. Select the part of the image you want to convert, then select ‘File’ and ‘Export’. In the dropdown bar, select ‘PNG’ and click ‘Export’. You’ll now have a PNG file wherever you saved it to on your computer.
Now, for users who don’t have access to Adobe products, there are two different third-party software methods of conversion. The first involves a web-based conversion. This is ideal for anyone who has fast internet access, limited hard drive space and only a few files to convert. All you’ll need to do for this is upload and then download a file. I recommend CloudConvert for browser-based conversions.
Finally, the other third-party conversion method is system-based, requiring users to install a program onto their computer before using it. This is best-suited for users who have a lot of hard drive space, slow internet access and a lot of files to convert. Once these programs are installed, you’ll never need the internet to make a conversion. I recommend reaConverter for system-based conversions.
Why make this conversion?
The AI file type is extremely helpful for creating designs that fall into niche categories. It’s unique compared to other image files, typically doing things other files cannot. Though all of this is great, there comes a time when the AI doesn’t measure up. This usually is a result of lack of functionality and accessibility.
For all of its impressive features, specificity limits the AI file extensively. It typically is only opened using Adobe Illustrator, a program not everyone has access to. By converting to the PNG, you’ll be able to share files quicker. Not only that, the users who receive these shared image files will have an easier time opening and editing them.
The AI was intended to help create very specific design details. At some point, the AI format will have served its purpose and you’ll then need to share or edit it. This inevitability requires the use of a different file type, so make sure you have a conversion method in mind."

March 16, 2020|
If you’re building brand graphics using Illustrator, chances are that most of your files are in the AI format. Though this is convenient under specific circumstances, it becomes an issue when it’s time to share. That is, unless you convert it to a different file type. Here’s a guide to help you convert the AI to a TIFF.
What is an AI image file?
The AI image file is the official digital file extension for the popular Adobe Illustrator program. It is highly scalable and uses vector graphics, a unique type of image. Vector graphics are constructed through the joining of different image points. These points have identifiers that help change and dictate factors of an image. The AI is typically used to create logos and images with extensive text included.
What is a TIFF image file?
The TIFF image file is a raster image that is capable of storing a vast amount of metadata within every file. TIFF stands for Tagged Image File Format. It is a highly secure choice for anyone who has sensitive images to store. The TIFF is a popular image choice due to its security and accessibility, capable of operating within many different systems. A lot of high resolution images are converted into TIFF.
How to make this conversion
Luckily, switching from the AI to the TIFF isn’t exclusive to those with access to the Adobe Illustrator program. There are some alternative systems capable of converting as well. However, using Illustrator is the easiest and most direct way. To convert using Illustrator, begin by loading Adobe Illustrator and opening your AI file. From the ‘File’ menu, select ‘Export’. Choose a location on your computer and name your file. Then, using the dropdown ‘Save As Type’ menu, choose ‘TIFF’. Click ‘Save’.
If you don’t have access to Illustrator, you can use a browser-based converter. This requires a few extra steps and internet access. Browser-based conversions are ideal for anyone who only needs a few files converted and has limited hard drive space. Though there are many different converters available, I recommend using Zamzar because of its amazing speed and simple interface.
Why convert?
The AI file type is a phenomenal format for a very specific group of actions and tasks. Outside of that, it’s not the most accessible file extension. When this becomes an issue, converting makes a lot of sense. Converting the AI into a more accessible file results in easier-to-share images across a wider spectrum of users. If you have to send out files to hundreds of users, chances are not all of them will be able to open the AI. Keep this in mind when navigating different campaign project details and options.
The TIFF is a great option to convert to because of its security, accessibility and size. If you’re sharing a lot of image files, it makes sense to offer them in the TIFF format so users can check the immense metadata and feel safer about the file. It’s also ideal because of how quickly it will send over things like email and digital messaging platforms. The quicker you can get the image files to other team members and clients, the more effective your campaigns will be.
The AI is great for building different brand images like logos and text-heavy pictures, but when it comes time to share these it lags behind. Switching to TIFF gives you a lot more options and extends the outreach of your powerful images. Make sure you know how to convert the AI to TIFF when the time comes."

November 19, 2019|
The CR2 is extremely important to photographers but it has limitations. These drawbacks include lack of edit-ability and lack of share-ability. Fortunately, the solution to these is simple: convert the CR2 to AI. Here’s a guide to help you learn how.
What is CR2?
The CR2 image file is the raw image digital representation of any photograph taken on a Canon camera then uploaded to a computer. CR2 is an acronym for Canon Raw 2, meaning second edition. It is extremely large in size and high in quality.
What is AI?
The AI image file is an Adobe Illustrator file format that is highly scalable and uses a unique graphic type, the vector. Vector graphics are built using different mathematical points, which determine numerous image factors. The AI is highly editable and can be manipulated in size without sacrificing quality.
How to convert CR2 to AI
There are two different ways to convert the CR2 to AI and both have specific benefits. The first way involves using browser-based converters. This method is perfect for users who only need to convert a limited amount of files. A browser-based system lets users use a browser for the entire conversion. It’s particularly ideal for users with limited hard drive space. All it takes is sufficient internet access to upload and download files, starting with the CR2 and finishing with the AI file. I recommend Convertio because of it’s fast download speeds and easy-to-use interface.
The second way to convert is by using a system that installs to your computer. This approach is great for people who have a large quantity of files to convert. A computer-based system allows users to take a large batch of files and convert them all at once. It’s specifically designed to benefit those with limited or slow internet access, as it doesn’t require an internet connection to use. Finally, it’s better for security reasons, as you don’t have to upload any files to the internet to convert. For this type of conversion I recommend ReaConverter, a fast system with a smooth interface.
Why convert?
The CR2 is typically the first step in the process of digital photography. Essentially, anyone who takes photos extensively with the Canon camera will eventually want to edit them digitally. They need to upload them to a computer to do so, which results in the CR2 file type. However, even though this is a high resolution file that represents the exact photo taken, it’s not in an editable format.
The AI file, on the other hand, has editing potential and can further build images into things such as logos. Furthermore, the AI is a much more reasonably-sized file format. This is essential for someone who wishes to share or upload a large quantity of CR2 files at once, since they’re so massive in size it would be difficult.
The CR2 is one of many fantastic image file types for maintaining the original quality and depiction of a photograph. However, it’s not functional for editing or practical for sharing. When this limits your potential, consider converting it to AI."

December 18, 2019|
The CR2 file type is an amazing way to digitize and preserve a photographer’s original intent. However, once it comes time to edit and share these files, they fall a little flat. Fortunately, you can convert the CR2 to an EPS in order to give yourself more room to work with. Here’s a breakdown of both the file types, followed by a guide to convert.
What is a CR2?
The CR2 image file is the extension used for photographs taken from a Canon camera and uploaded onto a computer. CR2 stands for Canon Raw 2, meaning the second edition, and it’s a large file size that offers high resolution images – raw images of photographs. The CR2 is tough to edit and is pretty tough to share due to its size.
What is an EPS?
The EPS image file stands for encapsulated postscript and gives valuable information about image files using image previews and descriptions. It holds both text and graphics and is customizable with immense potential for resizing. Many EPS images are purchased for the sake of size manipulations of some sort.
How to convert the CR2 to EPS
The EPS is a fairly unconventional, unique and complex file. Typically there’s a few manual options for converting image files but EPS requires outside software systems. There are in fact two different types of programs you could use, the first of which is a browser-based system. This type of tool is best for users who have fast internet connection, as it requires a download and upload. It’s also good for anyone who has limited hard drive space or who only needs to convert a few files. I prefer Convertio due to its fast speeds and easy-to-use interface.
The other way to convert is by using a system that installs to your computer. This option suits users who have a lot of hard drive space to store numerous files. It’s also great if you lack internet access or fast connection. Most importantly, it’s best for users who have a lot of different files to convert. If this type of system seems to fit you better, I recommend ReaConverter for it’s convenient, no-nonsense efficiency.
Why convert?
The EPS is essentially a bridge that allows photographers to move their work off their camera onto the computer. Outside of that, it really has very little purpose (other than being a raw image of what the photographer snapped). Because of this, it makes a lot of sense to convert it to a different image file type.
The reason the EPS functions so much better once converted is because other image types are much better when it comes to sharing and editing. The EPS is large in resolution and thus harder to share. It also is very hard to edit. The EPS, on the other hand, is a bit more accessible for all users.
Make sure you understand the ins and outs of the EPS before converting your CR2 files over. It’s not the most straightforward file type out there but it definitely has its advantages and needs to be considered."

April 28, 2020|
As you now probably know, it’s tough to find a solution to convert the CR2 to INDD. Don’t be discouraged, though, because I have a unique way to do it. Before you learn how to make this conversion, it’s important to have a firm grasp of both the CR2 and INDD. Here’s a breakdown of these image files, followed by how to convert.
What is the CR2?
The CR2 image file is a raw picture format for pictures taken using a Canon camera and then uploaded to any computer. CR2 (Canon Raw 2nd edition) is a way for photographers to retain the highest level of quality during the digitization process of their pictures. It is extremely large in size because of its high resolution, making it a candidate for conversion at some point.
What is the INDD?
The INDD is an Adobe InDesign file type that manages a wide scope of elements like page data and layouts. The INDD (InDesign file extension) is typically used by companies when they require professional design projects and creations like flyers. One important benefit it brings to the graphic landscape is the ability for users to add and change text and images throughout projects without compromising an underlying design.
How to convert the CR2 to INDD
There’s no legitimate way to convert the CR2 into an INDD file directly. However, there is a workaround that gives the same basic benefits. Here’s the easiest way to accomplish it. First, you’ll need to convert the CR2 into a file type capable of opening within INDD. Then, you’ll save the graphic inside INDD, which will make it, of course, an INDD file.
Here’s a complete breakdown of the process. Use a conversion tool to bring the CR2 into a more accessible format. In this case, we’ll use PSD. I recommend the browser-based conversion tool, Convertio. Once you have the PSD file downloaded, launch Adobe InDesign. Next, import your PSD file. Now, simply save this file in the INDD format. Although it’s not a direct conversion path, this is as good as it gets when you need to convert a CR2 to INDD.
What are some helpful alternatives?
As you can tell, it’s not easy to make a clean conversion from CR2 to INDD. Instead, we should look for some different ways to make our CR2 image file more editable. As we found above, it’s possible to convert it to a PSD. However, the PSD has a lot of limitations in terms of shareability, since it’s large in size and not every user has access to Adobe systems.
Instead, try converting to more common image file types such as JPEG, PNG or BMP. The Canon software ‘Canon RAW Codec’ unfortunately no longer exists (discontinued by Canon), so there’s no official software to save CR2 files as other file types. Instead, we’ll need to make similar conversions like the ones explained above. For example, there are plenty of browser-based systems capable of converting the CR2 to file types such as a JPEG. This will make the file easier to share and more convenient for recipients."

November 25, 2019|
The CR2 is such a beautiful image – a raw, unaltered look at a photographer’s work. Unfortunately, it’s large and can’t be edited. When it’s time to edit a CR2, users need a conversion. In this article, I’ll talk about a common conversion, from CR2 to JPG.
What is a CR2?
The CR2 image file is the official digital format for a photograph taken on a Canon camera and then uploaded onto a computer. CR2 stands for Canon Raw 2 (second edition). It is large in size and has very high resolution, due to the immense detail it contains of every photograph.
What is a JPG?
The JPG is a highly-popular file type because of its accessibility and convenient size. It’s interchangeable with the JPEG image file, so don’t get the two confused – they’re the same. The JPG is used most often when somebody needs to download or share a large amount of different images.
How to convert CR2 to JPG
Unlike with some other image file types, there’s no way to manually convert the CR2 to JPG. However, there are a couple different ways to convert using software programs. The first way is through a browser-based converter. This method is great for users with limited hard drive space and who wish to convert only a few files at a time. It’s important to have a fast internet connection when choosing this method, as you’ll have to both upload and download files. I highly recommend Convertio, as it has a simple interface and fast download speeds.
The second method involves downloading and installing a converter. This is better for users who have a lot of hard drive space and wish to convert a lot of files all at once. It’s also important for those with limited or slow internet access, as it doesn’t require internet access to use other than for the initial program download. I like the simplicity of the CR2 Converter.
Why convert?
Just as most photographers eventually put their pictures onto a digital format, they also eventually want to edit the files. However, in order to edit the CR2 image, it needs to be converted into a different file type. The CR2 is not only uneditable, it’s also very large in size. Though this is nice from a quality perspective, it’s equally terrible from an editing perspective.
To meet the demands of editing a CR2 using a different format, the JPG is quite appealing. It is a very manageable image size and can be opened using a plethora of editing programs. On top of all this, it’s much more accessible than a CR2. It would be inconvenient to all parties if you tried to share hundreds of CR2 files. However, that wouldn’t be the case with the smaller JPG.
It’s impossible to reverse your conversion back to CR2 once it’s a JPG, so make sure you keep an original copy just in case. Other than that, you shouldn’t have any problems with this conversion."
157,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-cr2-to-nef/,"Is it viable to convert the CR2 image file to the NEF?
January 16, 2020|
A lot of photographers and companies who work with photographers have dealt with both the CR2 and NEF file formats extensively. They understand the dilemma of these file types, in that they’re large and need to be converted to be edited and shared. Is it possible, then, to convert a CR2 into an NEF? Here’s a guide to break it all down for you.
What is the CR2 image file?
The CR2 image file is the standard digital file format for photographs snapped on any Canon camera and then downloaded onto a computer. CR2 officially stands for Canon Raw 2, the second edition. It is a raw representation of the exact image the photographer captured and is very large in size due to its high resolution.
What is the NEF image file?
The NEF image file is the standard digital file format for photographs taken from any type of Nikon camera. NEF stands for Nikon Electronic Format and is an exact replication of the picture taken by the photographer. It is large in size and is very high resolution.
Can you convert the CR2 to NEF?
As it stands, you cannot convert a CR2 file into an NEF. You cannot do it manually or even using a third party software system. However, you shouldn’t need to or won’t to anyway. Here’s why: a CR2 needs to be converted for a number of different reasons. The user may want to share a lot of CR2 files all at once and therefore want to convert it into a smaller file size. The NEF isn’t a smaller size than a CR2 anyway. Both take in the raw, unaltered version of a photograph.
A user may also want to convert the CR2 in order to make extensive edits to it. Unfortunately, yet again, the NEF doesn’t offer any further editing capability than the CR2. So once again, the conversion is pointless anyway. Ultimately, the CR2 and the NEF are the same file type for different camera equipment. It doesn’t make sense to convert one to the other. There are some different routes to go that would help, however.
Alternative solutions to consider
Now that we have confirmed the CR2 cannot be converted to the NEF, what are our options? Well, the first thing we can do is make a conversion to a different image file type. This will depend on different factors, such as why the user wants to convert. If you’re converting in order to edit your CR2 file(s), consider image file types such as the PSD or INDD. Both of these files are extremely editable due to the systems they belong to, Photoshop and InDesign. This conversion is simple to do and involves using a third-party software program such as a browser-based converter or a system-based converter (one you install onto your computer).
Alternatively, if you want to be able to share a lot of your CR2 images all at once, you might benefit from something like JPEGs or PNGs. These file types are known for their smaller size, which allows users to share a lot of them with minimal struggle. It’s important to point out, however, that the quality of a JPEG or PNG will be much lower than your original CR2. You can convert using a browser-based or system-based converter.
Ultimately, this conversion doesn’t work or even make any logical sense. Fortunately, once you understand this, you’ll know exactly how to make an alternative conversion to handle the required tasks."

February 17, 2020|
If you’ve been around camera files such as the CR2 for long enough, you understand that they don’t have the accessibility of other file types. When this realization strikes, typically users try to find a similar yet more accessible file to convert it to. Often times this leads to the idea of converting the CR2 to another raw file such as the ORF. Is this conversion possible and are there alternatives? Here’s a guide.
What is a CR2 image file?
The CR2 image file is the standard digital file format that results when images are pulled from a Canon camera and downloaded to a computer. CR2 is an acronym that stands for Canon Raw 2 (second edition). It is a large file size due to its high resolution. Its purpose is essentially to digitize a photographer’s work, giving a raw replication of every photo taken. The CR2 often needs a conversion in order to make it easier to edit and access.
What is an ORF image file?
The ORF image file is a default digital file format for images that are taken from an Olympus camera and downloaded to a computer. ORF is an acronym that stands for Olympus Raw Image File. It gives photographers a chance to digitize their collections, providing a raw representation of each image snapped. The ORF is likely to need an extra conversion due to its lack of accessibility.
How do I convert the CR2 to ORF?
For whatever reason, you’ve decided that your CR2 file(s) are best-served as an ORF. Maybe it’s because you read that the ORF is high resolution and you want your photos to stay high quality during the editing process. Unfortunately, this is a conversion that is practical only in theory. The reality of it is this conversion is not only impossible, it’s also not practical. Let me explain.
The CR2 is a high resolution image file that lacks a strong editing capability. Because of this, users seek out file conversions that might retain the quality and resolution. Naturally, this sometimes may land them on the ORF, another file type with extremely high resolution. Unfortunately, though, the ORF is specific to Olympus cameras, the same way the CR2 is specific to Canon cameras. Whether manually or automatically, this conversion is just not possible. There are some alternatives, however.
Is the inverse conversion possible? Are there alternatives?
Just in case this comes up again for you, the ORF to CR2 conversion is also not possible. For the same reasons listed above, the ORF and CR2 are simply too much alike for this conversion to be necessary anyhow. Plus, the two file types are very specific to their own camera products. It’s only natural, then, to seek out some alternatives. You’ll want to find some image files that are easier to edit, more accessible and easier to share.
I recommend converting your CR2 into more popular image file types, such as the PNG or JPEG. This conversion will unfortunately result in a lesser resolution but this is inevitable. The benefits will outweigh this downside. For example, you’ll have a portfolio of highly editable, sharable files. These files will be easier for any potential clients to open on their computers. If you do decide to make these conversions, it might be wise to use third-party software. There are plenty of systems that focus on raw conversions, such as the CR2 to PNG. You’ll inevitably have to choose between a browser-based system and an installable system.
The CR2 ultimately doesn’t convert into the ORF, though you know now that this conversion isn’t ideal anyway. Take your ideas and move them into a more reasonable solution. Chances are you’ll be much more satisfied with one of the alternatives."

January 23, 2020|
The CR2 format is great for photographers, allowing them the chance to digitize their collection. Unfortunately they often need extensive sharing which is difficult in their original format. When this is the case, it may be time to find a different format. Here’s a guide to convert a CR2 to a PDF.
What is a CR2?
The CR2 image file is the official digital file extension for photographs taken using a Canon camera and then downloaded to a computer. CR2 is an acronym for Canon Raw 2 (second edition). It is very large and takes up a lot of hard drive space because it contains the raw picture snapped on the camera in high resolution. The CR2 is not a very accessible image file and quite often needs to be converted in order to be shared and edited.
What is a PDF?
The PDF document file is a format capable of handling printed documents that include all types of media. PDF is an acronym for Portable Document Format. It lets users search and view links within large amounts of text and can hold multimedia like audio and video. The PDF is extremely secure and hard to edit, making it a strong choice for sharing sensitive information.
How to convert the CR2 to PDF
Unfortunately, the CR2 doesn’t come with software that allows it to easily convert into other formats. Instead, you’ll have to use a third-party program such as a browser-based converter or system-based converter. Both have their advantages, so make sure you understand them both before selecting one. The browser-based converter is best suited for users who have fast internet access and minimal hard drive space. It’s also ideal for when you only need to convert a few files rather than a large quantity. If this seems like it would benefit you, check out Convertio. They have a very fast download and upload speed, as well as a simple interface.
If the browser-based solution doesn’t suit you, there’s a downloadable, installable system that might work better. This type of system is better for users who have limited internet access and a lot of extra hard drive space. It’s also perfect for converting a lot of files all at once. If this sounds like it would work for you, consider using Reaconverter, an installable computer-based program that converts a lot of files at once. It doesn’t even require internet access past the initial installation.
Why convert?
There are a lot of different reasons one might convert. First, the CR2 is extremely large, which makes sharing it difficult. If a client were to request 300 photographs and you sent them in CR2 format, the process might be overwhelming and surely would be inconvenient. Converting them into a more serviceable document makes sense. Though the PDF is a document file instead of an image file, it’s capable of holding image files and would reduce the size (as well as the quality).
The PDF is also a much more secure file format than the CR2, so realistically if your photographs are meant to be seen very few and not intended to be edited, having it in the PDF makes a lot of sense. When sharing it, the receiving company won’t accidentally alter the contents if it’s in the PDF format. Also, putting the images into PDF format allows them to be built alongside print documents and other text-heavy files.
The CR2 is a phenomenal format for maintaining a raw replication of professional photographs. When it’s time to convert it, make sure you have a few different methods so you can do it the right way."

January 1, 2020|
The CR2 is a high resolution image that represents the exact photograph snapped by a cameraperson. However, it’s likely that at some point it will need to be converted into a more accessible file type. This guide will go over how to convert the CR2 to the PNG and why it’s important. First, here’s a look at both of these image file types.
What is a CR2?
The CR2 image file is the Canon Raw 2 (indicating second edition). It is the digital file format for pictures snapped on a Canon camera then downloaded onto a computer. It’s a very large file size, as it’s the raw, detailed image the photographer initially took with a camera. It’s very high in resolution as well, which maintains detail but toughens the sharing process.
What is a PNG?
The PNG image file is a raster image, which separates images by section essentially, assigning codes to each piece to help construct the photo. It is a lossless compression file, meaning it can undergo compression into much smaller size without losing any quality or resolution. Also, if the image is resized back to its original dimensions, the quality won’t be any different.
How to convert the CR2 to PNG
There are a few different ways to convert the CR2 to PNG, each of which have unique benefits. The first way to accomplish this conversion is by using a browser-based service. This method involves going to a webpage and uploading a CR2, then downloading a PNG file. Who stands to benefit from this type of process? Certainly, if you only have a few files to convert, this method works great. Also, anyone with fast internet would be fine using this, as the download and uploads wouldn’t take long. Lastly, users without a lot of hard drive space to spare would greatly benefit from this format. I recommend Convertio due to its fast upload speeds and simplistic interface.
The other method involves downloading and installing a conversion system to your computer. This is the better choice for someone who has limited internet access or likes to work offline a lot. With an installed system, you can convert without being connected to the net. This method also favors those who have a lot of extra hard drive space, because they can keep all the files on their computer without any trouble. Finally, it’s best suited for users who need to convert a large quantity of files all at once. A system that works great is the BatchImageConverter, which has a very easy setup and conversion tools.
Why convert?
The entire purpose behind bringing pictures off a camera onto a computer is typically to edit and share them. If, however, they’re too large in size, they’re tough to share. They’re also tough to edit if they’re in certain formats. This is the case for the CR2 image file. It is very large in size, thus tough to share. It’s also hard to edit.
This leads us to the PNG, a much simpler image file extension that is accessible by a lot of different users. Converting a lot of CR2 files into the PNG, users can share them more fluidly and edit them with a wider variety of programs. Ultimately, getting your CR2 files into something more manageable like the PNG allows for a lot of different possibilities.
The CR2 has its limitations but that doesn’t mean you need to be limited by it. By converting it into an accessible file type such as PNG, you give yourself a better chance to extensively edit and share your work."

October 28, 2019|
The CR2 offers a chance for users to view a raw, untouched version of a photographer’s vision. However, it’s likely that it will be better suited in a different format, such as PSD, for editing. Here’s how to convert the CR2 to PSD.
What is a CR2?
The CR2 image file is the standard digital file extension for all photographs taken using a Canon camera then uploaded to a computer. CR2 means Canon Raw 2, because it’s the second edition. It is a very large size due to high resolution image that results from its raw, unaltered nature.
What is a PSD?
The PSD image file is the digital file extension for files from the Adobe Photoshop program. The PSD is unique in that it can hold multiple images, unlike other file types. It also contains different aspects of a specific image. Ultimately, the PSD is best suited for extensive editing.
How to convert CR2 to PSD
In order to convert a CR2 to a PSD, you’ll need a third party software program. There are two different types to consider: browser-based systems and desktop systems. Browser-based systems are superior when you have only a file or two to convert. They’re also more convenient when you’re lacking hard drive space and don’t want to clutter your computer with a new program. When seeking out a converter, it’s best to find one that has a simple interface and fast upload/download speeds. I think Convertio matches these qualifications and I recommend it.
The desktop-based systems, on the other hand, are superior for users with large quantities of files they need converted. They are also ideal for someone who has limited internet access. When looking for a desktop system, consider the hard drive space it will take up and how many files you have to convert at once. Make sure the program you choose can handle a large quantity. PearlMountain makes it easy to convert in bulk.
Why convert?
The CR2 is a raw image file, containing all of the original graphic makeup from the photograph. This is great for viewing the picture in its intended form but it fails to meet other standards. For one, it’s very hard to share a photograph collection made up of CR2 images. They are large in size, requiring the recipient to have a lot of hard drive space and a fast connection.
They also are a lot harder to edit in their raw form. This is why the PSD is such a good option to convert to. The PSD is specifically designed to be edited. In fact, Photoshop has some of the best editing tools available. If a photographer was looking to make very specific edits to his or her pictures, the PSD would give them the best chance.
The CR2 is a high resolution image file that gives great insight into the true nature of a photographer’s work. Unfortunately, it is a bit too large and needs to be edited. For this reason, converting to a PSD is necessary. Make sure you know how."

January 8, 2020|
The CR2 is used by photographers to bring their pictures into a digital format. However, these images usually require editing and sharing, which is hard to do in the CR2 format. Luckily, it’s not difficult to change the file into a different type. Here’s how to convert the CR2 to a TIFF.
What is a CR2?
The CR2 image file is the official file extension format for any photograph snapped using a Canon camera and then uploaded to a computer and digitized. It stands for Canon Raw 2, meaning second edition. The CR2 is a very large file because it is a high resolution, raw representation of the photograph taken.
What is a TIFF?
The TIFF image file is a raster image that stands for Tagged Image File Format. It uses metadata more than other image types do, making it easier to search for and categorize TIFF files. It’s also a very safe format, especially due to its metadata. Lastly, its transparency makes it especially valued among users who share and receive a lot of different image files.
How to convert the CR2 to TIFF
There are two different ways to make a conversion from CR2 to TIFF. The first is for users who only need to convert a few different files. When this is the case, a browser-based program works best. These systems don’t require the installation of a program onto your computer. All you have to do is upload your CR2 then download the TIFF file it converts it to. The browser-based system is great for users with limited hard drive space and speedy internet connection. I recommend Zamzar due to its simple interface and fast upload speeds.
The other method is for users who have a large quantity of files they need converted. When this is necessary, a system-based converter program is optimal. This type of program installs to your computer and allows conversions without internet access. It’s also great for anyone who has extensive amounts of hard drive space to spare. I recommend CR2Converter for its simplicity.
Why convert?
If you have a lot of CR2 files on your system, you probably enjoy their raw, untouched quality and high resolution. However, you realize they’re nearly impossible to edit and share in their current state. For this reason, it makes a lot of sense to convert them into more manageable image file types. There are a lot of different formats you could convert to. If you want a file that is extremely safe for sharing, the TIFF is probably your best bet.
The reason you might convert your CR2 files to a TIFF is because you might need to send out important and sensitive photographs to clients or coworkers. The TIFF guarantees a safer process for your recipients, which will make you look professional. Also, the TIFF houses metadata drastically, giving more tags to your images for easier use.
Converting the CR2 is a great way to make your pictures more accessible. Make sure you know the best method of conversion for your personal preference."

February 26, 2020|
The EPS gives users a chance to customize and preview their images. However, it’s not very popular, which could cause some problems when sharing it. When this comes up, consider switching file types. One potential new extension is the AI, the Adobe format. If you’re not sure how or why to convert the EPS to AI, don’t worry, this guide will take care of everything. First, let’s make sure you have a strong understanding of both the EPS and AI files.
What is an EPS image file?
The EPS image file is a valuable image format because it gives users the unique chance to preview the graphics within a file. It also provides details into image files based on descriptions. EPS stands for Encapsulated Postscript. It is a customizable image type that contains text and graphics. It’s most commonly used for resizing images, since a lot of EPS images are purchased and then changed in size.
What is the AI image file?
The AI image file is the standard format for Adobe Illustrator files. It is often used in professional settings by companies in need of extensive logos and graphic designs. It gives users the ability to create text on different images and drawings. It’s a high resolution format and has strong functionality. Lastly, it’s a vector graphic type, which means it is created using different indicators and factors.
How to convert the EPS to AI
There’s no way to manually convert the EPS by saving it as an AI file type, so you’ll have to use a third-party program for assistance. There are two ways to go about this. The first is to use a browser-based conversion system. This makes sense for anyone who only has a few files to convert. It’s also ideal for users with fast internet access and minimal hard drive space, due to the fact that this method requires downloading and uploading. I recommend EPSConverter, a specialized program for EPS conversions.
The next way to make a conversion is by using a batch converter, which installs to your system and allows you to convert more than one file at a time. This is recommended for users who have plenty of hard drive space and slow internet speeds. You don’t have to use the internet in order to make your conversions with this method. It’s also perfect for users who want to convert hundreds of files. Check out reaConverter for an effective batch converter system.
Why make this conversion?
There are two main reasons why you might consider converting your EPS to an AI. The first reason is that the AI offers different types of options and layouts. If you’re hoping to add a lot of different materials to an image, the AI is better equipped to handle these types of actions. It’s also better for professional use, making it an ideal conversion for companies looking for a more effective file type.
The next reason to convert is the EPS isn’t an extremely popular file type. Though this sometimes isn’t a big deal, it becomes a problem when users want to share their EPS extensively. The more often you need to share your images, the more likely it becomes that a recipient won’t be able to access and work with it. Adobe files are better suited for this type of sharing and make the process a lot easier.
It happens all too often that we purchase an EPS and realize it’s not going to work for us in that format. When this is the case, be prepared to convert it to a file type like the AI. The easier this process is for you, the more time you’ll save."

December 20, 2019|
The EPS lacks accessibility, shareability and is outdated. When it just won’t cut it, it’s time to change to a different image file. If you’re thinking it would be better served as an INDD, it might be difficult to figure out on your own how to convert. Luckily for you, we’ve got the steps laid out to make it as easy as possible.
What is an EPS?
The EPS image file stands for encapsulated postscript. It’s a way for users to examine image files using special previews or by reading descriptions before opening the file. The EPS is a customizable file that typically contains images, though it is capable of containing text as well. The EPS is outdated but it’s most common use is for resizing different images in numerous ways.
What is an INDD?
The INDD file is an Adobe InDesign file extension that is designed to handle elements like books and flyers. It handles projects that require different items and pieces to remain consistent throughout. It’s quite a large image file, and includes elements such as layouts, page data and more. It’s not typically used outside of the Adobe systems.
How to convert the EPS to INDD
Converting the EPS to INDD is quite tricky but I’ve found some ways to get the job done. Both of these file types are quite inaccessible and tough to convert so there’s unfortunately no third party software to automate this process. That being said, it can be done with some extra steps and some creativity. The first thing you’ll need to do is realize that the path from EPS to INDD is not going to happen. However, when you include a different image file, it becomes possible to get from EPS to INDD. For example, if we first convert the EPS to the JPG image file and then convert the JPG to INDD, we’ve made our conversion in a roundabout way.
Naturally then, we need to learn how to convert the EPS to different file types in order to complete the entire process. We’ll use JPG again. First, convert the EPS to JPG using a converter. I recommend Zamzar for their fast speeds and simple browser-based interface. Now that you have a JPG file, you need to open it within InDesign. To do this, launch InDesign and create a new document. Then under ‘File’ select ‘Place’ and import the JPG. Place the image inside the document and then save the new file.
How to reverse convert (INDD to EPS)
There were quite a few steps required to make our conversion. Fortunately, the inverse conversion is much easier. All it takes to convert the INDD back to the EPS is some simple software tools. However, the tools are not browser-based like the above.
To convert your INDD back to an EPS, simply download and install one of the many tools available capable of converting. The one I prefer is QuarkXPress, a modern graphic design software. This tool is perfect for those needing a large quantity of conversions, especially if your internet access is slow.
Why convert?
The main reason someone might make this conversion is they’re just more comfortable working within the InDesign software system. This might be because of all the editing tools at their disposal or simply the fact they’re more comfortable with the system.
It’s also likely that the EPS is just too outdated and inefficient for most users. It’s hard to imagine a time where sharing a file as an EPS would make sense. For these reasons it seems reasonable to need some sort of change.
The EPS to INDD conversion is ultimately difficult but possible in an indirect way. The first step on the journey is understanding the why part of conversion. Once you have that down, the how should make a lot more sense."
165,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-eps-to-nef/,"A complete guide to convert the EPS file to NEF
January 27, 2020|
If you work extensively with the EPS format, you’re aware of all the highly beneficial functions it provides as an image file. However, sometimes it doesn’t fit what you’re doing. When this happens, it’s natural to try to convert it into a different format. Is it then possible to convert it to, say, a NEF file? This article breaks everything down.
What is an EPS?
The EPS image file is an essential format for handling different logos, print and images. EPS stands for Encapsulated Postscript and offers solid information concerning image files using a descriptive text or graphic preview. The EPS is an important format due to its immense resizing capabilities – a must for most images bought in the EPS extension, as they’re typically meant to be resized.
What is a NEF?
The NEF image file is a digital file that contains a raw image of any photograph taken using a Nikon camera then uploaded to a computer. NEF stands for Nikon Electronic Format. It contains the exact photographed image with the exact same resolution until it is eventually converted. Converting the NEF is necessary when users want to edit and share the file.
Is it possible to convert the EPS to NEF?
As you know, the NEF is a raw image from a camera. This format is typically the beginning of a process (editing, sharing, etc.) rather than the ending. For this reason, converting an EPS to NEF isn’t possible or even logical. It would be like trying to convert a pumpkin pie into a chocolate birthday cake. In fact, no image files convert into the NEF.
The NEF, in fact, is a detailed image file that is used to represent precise photos snapped by photographers. Its purpose is to maintain the initial resolution and detail of an image. Eventually, it’s destined to be converted into a different image file. This is because it’s hard to edit the NEF in its current format. It’s also easier to share with other users once converted due to a reduction in size. With that in mind, what then can we do with our EPS files?
What are our other options?
First, note that, if necessary, it’s possible to convert the NEF to EPS. If you have some NEF files you wish to be moved into the EPS format, there are some browser-based conversion systems more than capable of performing this. One such system is Convertio, a fast service that is perfect for users with strong internet access. This conversion gives users a chance to manage their NEF file better, editing and sharing it much easier.
If, however, you’re still looking for a way to convert your EPS, it’s possible to look for other formats. We know formats such as NEF, CR2, etc. won’t work. However, simpler formats such as JPG and PNG should. In fact, if you have access to Adobe Illustrator, you’ll be able to convert the EPS to a JPG manually using the program. If you want it in PNG format, there’s browser-based converters, such as Zamzar, to help you pull this off. Either way, these extensions should help you manage your files much easier than if you could somehow convert to the NEF.
At the end of the day, the EPS just doesn’t convert to the NEF. However, when you think about it, it’s not a logical conversion to perform anyway. You don’t need the EPS to behave like the NEF. Take this knowledge and convert your EPS into a different file format."

April 10, 2020|
When you need to convert the EPS to a PDF, it’s important to have different methods available for efficiency. Here is a comprehensive guide explaining different ways to make this conversion and why it’s important. Before we go into the conversion, here’s a quick explanation of both of these file types.
What is an EPS image file?
The EPS image file is a popular way for businesses to manage different branding graphics and logos. It’s also one of the most common image types purchased by companies, due to the fact it’s easy to customize and resize. EPS stands for Encapsulated PostScript. The EPS is fairly accessible, as users of both the Windows and Mac operating systems can open it with standard tools.
What is a PDF document file?
The PDF document file is a highly-popular, professional file type. It’s an efficient format that gives users the chance to extensively search large amounts of text. PDF is an acronym for Portable Document Format. It is capable of holding multimedia, like audio and video. It’s considered one of the most secure file types, with numerous options to change the access level.
Now that you have the basics of each file type, here’s how to make a conversion using them:
How to convert the EPS to PDF
There are quite a few ways to make this conversion, which is highly convenient for users with different preferences. The first way is by using Adobe Illustrator. First, open your Illustrator program. Next, open your EPS file. Then, select ‘Save As’ and choose ‘PDF’ when prompted. Select a location and give it a new file name. You should now have a PDF file saved on your computer. If you don’t have Illustrator, there are other ways to go about this.
For those of you without access to Adobe programs, you can convert using an automated system. A browser-based converter, for example, is a fast way to switch over. All it requires is a reliable, decently-fast internet connection and enough hard drive space to save the new file (which shouldn’t be a problem, considering how small the file will likely be). For this type of conversion, I prefer using Zamzar, a browser-based system designed to quickly switch an EPS into a PDF file without any extra steps.
Why is this conversion so important?
For some users, converting the EPS to a PDF is going to be a matter of convenience. There are times when we are working with certain file types and we have to share them with other users. If the recipient doesn’t have a way to open an EPS, for example, it makes sense to put it into a PDF for them. This comes up quite a bit when completing projects and working with team members and externals.
Another reason this conversion makes sense is if you’re looking for a way to manage your image file in a document. This is generally ideal when creating some type of print project. The PDF is a document file that holds all types of media content, including images, so converting makes quite a bit of sense here.
Whether it’s a matter of convenience, compatibility or accessibility, the need to convert from EPS to PDF will likely occur at some point. When it happens, make sure you have a few good options to get the job done."

March 2, 2020|
The EPS is a phenomenal file type for users who want a high resolution image type. Though it has a lot of unique features, it’s also not the most popular format. When this becomes a problem, consider converting the EPS to a PNG. Here’s a guide to show you how. Let’s start with a brief rundown of both the EPS and PNG file types.
What is the EPS image file?
The EPS image file stands for Encapsulated Postscript. It offers users a chance to gather valuable information about an image file using a preview or a brief description. The EPS is highly-valued due to its customization features and its ability to hold both text and graphics. The EPS is mostly known for its resizing qualities, changing the size of images without sacrificing excessive quality while doing so.
What is the PNG image file?
The PNG image file stands for Portable Network Graphic. It is a raster image, which means it constructs its graphic by assigning different colors to divided sections. These sections use these color assignments to construct an overall image piece-by-piece. The PNG is widely-used because of its accessibility and lossless compression. Lossless is a feature that implies an image file retains all its resolution despite being shrunk in dimensions.
How to convert the EPS to a PNG
If you’re fortunate enough to have Adobe Illustrator, you’ll be able to manually convert the EPS to a PNG. This method only takes a few steps and is generally a lot easier than using a third-party system (if you don’t have access to illustrator, skip to the next paragraph). First, import your EPS file into Illustrator. Then select ‘File’ and ‘Export’. In the ‘Format’ dropdown menu, select ‘PNG’. You’ll now have a PNG version of the EPS image on your computer wherever you chose to save it.
If you don’t have Illustrator, don’t worry. You can automate this conversion process without downloading any software tools. This is done with the help of a browser-based converter. You’ll need an internet connection and enough hard drive space to download some new files. All you’ll do to perform this action is navigate your browser to one of the many conversion systems and upload your EPS, then download your new PNG file from the site directly. I recommend using Zamzar due to its fast download speeds and intuitive features.
Why make this conversion?
The most common to convert and EPS to PNG is the fact that EPS is super inaccessible and tough to edit. There are a limited number of programs capable of opening an EPS and some of them don’t allow for editing. To overcome this, switch to a PNG. Numerous programs are capable of both opening and editing a PNG. There could potentially be some quality loss when editing the PNG but this is within an acceptable range.
The EPS is also quite unpopular. Though this may not matter when considering your personal use of the file type, it might come up when delivering it to clients and other members of your enterprise teams. Conversely, the PNG is a very popular, accessible image file that a lot of users have complete access to. By converting, you create a much easier time for all recipients to open and edit your files.
It’s very common to purchase image files in the EPS format. However, it’s also quite common that the EPS doesn’t work great for us. When this happens, make sure you understand how to quickly convert to a popular format like PNG."

When this time comes, you’ll want to convert it into a different file format. In this article, I’ll explain why it makes since to convert the eps to a psd. I’ll also explain how to make this conversion quickly and easily.
What is an EPS file?
The EPS image file stands for Encapsulated Postscript and is an image file that gives users information about its contents through an image preview or text description. The EPS is resizable and is often created or downloaded with the intention of being altered in some way. It stands out due to the fact it’s capable of containing graphics as well as text.
The EPS is accessible through both the Windows and Mac operating systems. It is known to be quite an adaptable image format. There are different ways to open the EPS, though the most popular method is with the Adobe Reader program. Lastly, there are different third-party software programs that can open an EPS.
What is a PSD file?
The PSD image file stands for Photoshop Document and is an image file that the program Adobe Photoshop creates. What makes the PSD so unique is it contains numerous different image aspects. It is highly editable, as Photoshop was designed to be a graphics-editing tool.
The easiest way to access a PSD is with the Adobe Photoshop software, though there are alternatives. Typically, programs that are capable of opening different images are able to open a PSD as well. These programs are likely to be pre-installed onto common operating systems.
How to convert
There’s no way to manually convert the EPS to PSD, since it’s not possible to edit the vector graphics of EPS inside Photoshop and save it as a Photoshop file. However, there are programs available to force this conversion. The first thing you need to consider is what type of converter you need – browser-based or system-based. You likely want a browser-based converter if you have limited hard drive space, fast or abundant internet access and only a few files to convert. Check out Convertio for an easy-to-use browser-based converter with fast download speeds.
If you don’t fall into the above category, you may prefer a system-based converter, one that installs directly to your computer. These are particularly favorable for users who have limited to no internet access, exceptional hard drive space and a large quantity of files to convert. I’ve found ReaConverter to be great at handling this type of conversion.
Why convert?
The EPS is a slightly outdated file format, leaving a lot to be desired by forward-thinking companies and advanced users. Though the EPS is in fact customizable, the reality is it doesn’t meet the accessibility capabilities of other image file types. Furthermore, the popularity of Photoshop makes having the EPS in PSD format much more valuable.
If you’re a large company, it’s going to make a lot of sense to convert most of your EPS files you want edited into the PSD. Chances are your team members are much more capable and familiar with Adobe Photoshop and its extensive tools. Use this as a way to be more efficient and make projects easier on everyone.
The EPS has a lot of cool features that cannot be overlooked. However, there are often times when a different format works better. Be prepared for this inevitability by understanding when and how to convert to a PSD."

March 30, 2020|
The EPS is a unique image file with specific features and distinct abilities. Though this is often helpful, there may come a time when a different image format is needed. One such format might be the TIFF, another niche image extension. The following is a guide to show how to convert the EPS to TIFF. First, we’ll cover the basics of the EPS and TIFF to make sure you have a firm understanding of how they work.
What is an EPS image file?
The EPS image file is a powerful format for users who need extensive work with logos and print. EPS stands for Encapsulated PostScript. It is a common format for images that are purchased digitally. A lot of companies buy and download digital images for their websites in the EPS format. This is typically because of its important resizing and editing abilities.
What is a TIFF image file?
The TIFF image file is a unique format with dynamic, modern security features and benefits. TIFF is an acronym for Tagged Image File Format. It’s a raster image, meaning the entirety of its graphics are built using a group of different, individual pixels. The TIFF is an accessible file, capable of being opened by standard systems within the Windows and Mac operating systems.
Now that you have a firm grasp of both of these file formats, here’s a guide to help you convert them efficiently.
How to convert the EPS to TIFF
There are fortunately a couple different ways to convert from an EPS to a TIFF. Both are quite different and serve users with widely varying needs, so I’ll break down each one for you. The first conversion method is an automated, browser-based conversion. This is ideal for anyone who has limited hard drive space, as it doesn’t require a large quantity of stored files. It’s also best to use a browser-based service if you have a fast internet connection, since it requires uploading and downloading. For this type of conversion, I recommend using Convertio. It is a fast conversion service with a simple interface.
The next type of conversion method is by using a batch converter, which is system-based. This type of tool installs directly to your machine and converts numerous files all at once. If you have limited access to the internet or a slow connection, this method is ideal for you since it doesn’t require access after installation. It’s also best suited for users who have a lot of hard drive space and need a bunch of files converted all at once. For a batch conversion, I recommend the tool reaConverter. It is easy-to-use and not too large in size.
Why is this conversion helpful?
If EPS and TIFF are both very niche, unique image file types, why would anyone want to convert one into the other – in this case EPS to TIFF? The answer lies in the specificity of each of their features and benefits. TIFF might excel in an area that the EPS struggles in. When this is the case, a conversion is important. Here are some specific reasons to make this conversion.
One reason to convert the EPS to the TIFF is when the specific situation warrants it. Though this doesn’t have anything to do about the benefits or disadvantages of the file type, it does happen from time-to-time. An example would be if you were sending an EPS to a fellow team member for a project and they didn’t have the capability to open an EPS. You could convert it to a TIFF if that were their preferred format. Another reason to convert would be the resizing potential of the TIFF. This is what the TIFF is known for. When you need to drastically change the size of your image, the TIFF works quite well.
The EPS is rather unique and helpful in a lot of different areas, though this doesn’t please everyone. If you’re one of the few who needs something else, make sure you understand how to make a quick conversion."
170,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-indd-to-jpg/,"How to convert the INDD image file to a JPG
February 10, 2020|
The INDD offers so much to users, it’s often forgotten that sometimes so much is too much. When you need a less-dense file type, consider converting the INDD to a file type like JPG. If you don’t know how, here’s a simple guide to help you out.
What is the INDD?
The InDesign file extension (INDD) is the official format for the software program Adobe InDesign. As you might have guessed, INDD stands for InDesign. It contains numerous different design elements, such as layouts, files and page information. The most typical uses of an INDD file are creating newspapers, publishing flyers and managing other professional layouts.
What is the JPG?
The JPG image file is the Joint Photographic Experts Group official extension. Though the acronym doesn’t match, JPG is interchangeable with JPEG. The JPG is an accessible, reasonably-sized image file that allows for extensive versatility. It is a lossy compression format which indicates a gradual quality loss as users reduce its size.
How to convert the INDD to JPG
There are typically numerous automated methods, such as software tools, to make image-to-image conversions for you. Unfortunately in the case of the InDesign file, no such application exists. This is because the INDD file is quite complex and the idea of forcing it to exist as a different image type is illogical. Luckily, because of the versatility and power of Adobe InDesign, you can perform this conversion manually.
In order to make this conversion, begin by opening Adobe InDesign. Load an image that you wish to convert. Select the object, then under ‘File’ select ‘Export’. In the new window, name the file and designate a place for it on your computer (or cloud storage system if applicable). Next, in the dropdown menu ‘Save as Type’, select JPG. In the new window, choose ‘Selection’. Any extra options can be answered to your liking. Finally, click ‘Export’.
Why is this conversion valuable?
The INDD to JPG conversion definitely has some merit. The easiest, most basic reasons for this are functionality and simplicity. INDD files are perfect for editing, as they are the standard file for Adobe InDesign. However, they lack functionality and versatility in other areas. For example, imagine you decide to share a batch of INDD files with a client. If they don’t have access to InDesign, they’ll find it difficult to open the images.
In a different way, a JPG is much easier to share. Not only because of how much more accessible it is than the INDD but also because it is compact and simple. On top of being able to open the file without third party software, a recipient can won’t have to take up a lot of hard drive space downloading it. They also won’t have extensive download (and potentially, later on, upload) times.
The INDD is a complex image file. Though there are a lot of benefits that come with this, sometimes it’s convenient to reduce this complexity. When you need a simpler image type, consider the JPG and make sure you have the conversion process down."

April 16, 2020|
The INDD is a popular file type for users who need immense design capabilities. While working on a project using the INDD, it’s possible a conversion will be required. When that time comes, make sure you understand how to do so quickly and efficiently. If you’re looking to convert the INDD to NEF, this guide is for you. Before we get into the conversion details, here is a rundown of the two file types.
What is the INDD?
The INDD, which is the official InDesign file extension, is the standard format for project files in Adobe’s design software. The INDD handles many different elements, such as page information and layouts. It is typically used by companies in need of extensive design tools and capabilities. INDD files usually hold things like flyers and digital magazines. Users are able to add or change text of a project without compromising the overall design.
What is a NEF image file?
The NEF image file is the standard format for any picture snapped using a Nikon camera. NEF (Nikon Electronic Format) is a raw image, meaning it is unedited or changed from the original picture. The NEF is mostly used by professional photographers. When it’s time to share an NEF album or upload them online, users typically convert them into a smaller file.
Is it possible to convert the INDD to NEF?
Although it sounds like a beneficial conversion in theory, with NEF files being so high in resolution, there isn’t any way to actually do it. The NEF is a file that is specifically the direct result of a camera picture uploaded to a computer. It acts as a way for users to put their Nikon camera photos onto a digital format. Because of this, no conversion from INDD to NEF works. Fortunately, this type of conversion isn’t practical anyway. Here’s why.
The NEF is a raw image file, giving users a chance to have a digitized version of their physical photographs. Because of how high resolution the NEF is, users sometimes mistakenly believe an INDD can convert into it and gain that level of quality. Of course, this isn’t actually possible. The good thing is there are plenty of alternative conversions that offer these types of qualities.
What are some alternative solutions?
Chances are if you’re trying to convert to an NEF, you need a file with high resolution. This is going to be hard to match exactly, but there are some alternatives that come close. The PNG is an extremely high resolution file type that maintains a lot of image quality. Plus, the PNG is a lot more accessible than the NEF, making it easier to share with others. Here’s how to convert the INDD to the PNG.
First, you’ll need access to both InDesign and Illustrator. If you don’t have one, consider a free trial to make this conversion. Launch InDesign and select ‘file’>‘export’ and choose ‘EPS’. Now launch Illustrator and open this EPS file. Now, simply save this file as a PNG. This isn’t a direct conversion, but it’s a great workaround when you need a new file type for a project.
Even though there’s now way to convert the INDD to NEF, that doesn’t mean you’re out of options. Think about which different image file types might suit you as well and use them as an alternative."

March 24, 2020|
The INDD is a unique file type that a lot of users prefer for its design potential. There likely will come a time when it makes sense to convert the INDD to a different extension. The ORF might seem appealing when this is the case. Here’s a breakdown of how to convert the INDD to ORF.
What is the INDD?
The INDD (InDesign file extension) is the main format used by the Adobe InDesign system. It is capable of handling a large range of different elements, like layouts, page data and other files. The INDD is often the go-to system for companies who need professional design creations like flyers and layouts. It allows users to add different text and graphics throughout a project without changing the overall design.
What is the ORF?
The ORF image file is the standard digital format which all photographs snapped on Olympus cameras are saved into. ORF stands for Olympus Raw Image File. The ORF is typically opened and edited within the Olympus Viewer, which is the standard program for Olympus cameras. Though this gives users some editing potential, they usually convert the ORF to a different file type to further their editing.
How to convert the INDD to ORF
Unfortunately, there’s no way possible to convert the INDD to the ORF. The ORF is a digital file that is exclusively the result of a camera taking a photo and uploading it to a computer. If the source isn’t an Olympus camera, no file is going to turn into an ORF. However, the idea of converting an INDD to an ORF, though enticing, isn’t logical.
The ORF is a high resolution image file that provides a detailed replica of a photograph. This doesn’t mean that any INDD image might be converted into an ORF to share these same qualities. Besides, the INDD has many qualities of its own that would be lost by switching it to a file type similar to ORF. Instead, you should seek out formats which closely resemble the benefits of the ORF that are compatible with the INDD. Here are some possible alternatives.
Alternative conversion solutions
The ORF retains a lot of quality within, staying rather large but keeping the true nature of an image intact. Here are some alternatives which are similar. The first notable solution with these potential qualities is the PNG. Like the ORF, the PNG is a very large file size and has tremendous resolution and visual quality. Best of all, the INDD converts to a PNG, though it does take a few extra steps.
The first thing you’ll need to do is export your INDD file as an EPS. Though this is an indirect path, it’s necessary. Using InDesign, select ‘file’ then ‘export’ then save the file as an EPS. Next, open the newly-created EPS file using Adobe Illustrator. Then, using Illustrator, save the file as a PNG. This is a roundabout way to convert the INDD to a PNG but there are no third party systems dedicated to making this conversion.
It might be a disappointment that you’re unable to convert a TIFF to an ORF, seeing the benefits a high resolution file might have brought to your project. However, if you’re able to find a strong alternative, you’ll realize there are plenty of similar formats with great features."

December 5, 2019|
The JPG is a conveniently-sized editable file that is quite popular among image files. However, it’s not always the right choice for a project. When it’s time to use a more editable format, consider converting it to an AI. Here’s a breakdown of the how and why.
What is a JPG?
The JPG image file is a digital file type from the Joint Photographic Experts Group. The JPG is interchangeable with the JPEG image file and is a popular file extension because of its manageable size. It uses lossy compression, which means it loses quality as it gets smaller in size. It’s very easy to share, download and upload it.
What is an AI File?
The AI image file is an Adobe Illustrator file format which uses vector graphics. Vector graphics are constructed using different connected points which have specific indicators to organize image factors and elements. The AI is typically used for things like brand logos and image text placements.
How to convert
The first way to convert is by using the Adobe Illustrator program. This option is of course best suited for someone with access to Illustrator. Open the file inside Illustrator. Then, using ‘File’, select ‘Export’ then select the desired format. Then select ‘Save’. Remember that this option allows for editing of the image inside Illustrator as well.
Next, if you don’t have Illustrator, you’ll need to use a third-party system. There are two different types. The first type is a browser-based system, which you access using a web browser. This method is great for users who have fast internet access. It’s also best for users who have limited hard drive space and who only need to convert a limited number of files. I recommend using Convertio, which has very fast download and upload speeds, as well as a simple interface.
Finally, the last way to convert is by using a system-based converter which you install directly to your computer. This option is particularly helpful to users who have a lot of hard drive space, since they can store the large files on their system. It’s also great if someone doesn’t have fast internet, since this option doesn’t require internet after installation. Finally, it’s perfect for users who want to convert a lot of files all at once. For this I recommend ReaConverter, which is easy-to-use and works efficiently to convert a lot of files at once.
Why convert?
The JPG is merely a basic image file that has editing capabilities subject to whichever programs are capable of using it. Therefore, bringing it into Illustrator allows advanced technical users the opportunity to create even further and edit more efficiently. Once inside Illustrator, all the tools that come along with it are used to change the JPG image into whatever design the user desires.
Remember that ultimately, both files are editable. The JPG is easy to open and small in size. However, AI files are editable at a much more technical level across the board. When editing is your number one priority, converting makes sense."

October 21, 2019|
The CR2 is the official format of image files from Canon camera photographs. It’s extremely high resolution, making some users wonder if it’s possible to convert a JPG into a CR2. Is this even conceivable? Here’s an in-depth explanation.
What is a JPG?
The JPG image file is a digital file format from the Joint Photographic Experts Group. JPG is interchangeable with the JPEG image file. It’s a highly popular file type that uses lossy compression, meaning it loses resolution as it shrinks in size. It’s easy to share and download due to its smaller size.
What is a CR2?
The CR2 image file is a digital file format for photographs taken using a Canon camera and transferred to a computer. CR2 stands for Canon Raw 2, which indicates it is the second edition. It is a raw, unaltered image with high resolution, making it very detailed and large in size.
How to convert JPG to CR2
Is it possible to convert a JPG to CR2? Though it seems like doing so would have some advantages, such as a higher resolution, it’s just not achievable. There’s unfortunately no way to make this conversion, no matter if you try manually or by attempting to find a converter. No route exists for manual conversion and no such converter exists. So why doesn’t it work to convert a JPG to CR2?
The reason a JPG doesn’t convert into CR2 is the CR2 is the image file format for Canon photographs. They are raw, untouched pictures that represent the exact photograph snapped. This conversion is the equivalent of converting a finished movie back into a film scene, filled with actors waiting to say their lines – it’s just not possible. However, the inverse is indeed possible.
How to convert CR2 to JPG
The CR2 is typically converted into different image file types for things like editing and file sharing. The CR2 isn’t the easiest to edit file but other formats allow it to be drastically altered. On top of that, once it’s converted it reduces in size, making it a lot easier to share. There are two different ways to convert. The first method is by downloading a conversion software. This is a great choice for users who have a lot of different CR2 files they want converted all at once. It’s also ideal for those who have limited internet access. Movavi is a desktop system that seamlessly makes this conversion.
The other method to convert is by using a browser-based system. This is ideal for people who want to quickly convert a file without the hassle of installing a new program. It’s also perfect for anyone who lacks hard drive space. Zamzar is a browser-based system that has a simple interface with fast upload speeds.
Ultimately, it’s impossible at this point in time to convert a JPG to CR2 – plus it’s unnecessary. The JPG is already in the correct format for editing. If anything, you may want to use the JPG as a landing point in which to convert your CR2 files instead."

May 5, 2020|
It’s not so easy to use the JPG in each one of your projects, especially when considering the fact that preferences differ across each user group. Fortunately, the JPG is pretty accessible and comes with many different ways to change it. One of these ways is through conversion, which gives users unique image options. Here’s a guide on how to convert the JPG to an EPS file.
What is the JPG image file?
The JPG image file is, as you may have guessed, the exact same format as the JPEG. They’re interchangeable, both being the official extension of the Joint Photographic Experts Group. The JPG is super accessible for all users due to its small size and simple features. It is a lossy file type, meaning it loses resolution while compressing.
What is the EPS image file?
The EPS image file (Encapsulated PostScript) is one of the most powerful, unique and versatile image file types available. It has many different features that professionals use during extensive projects and campaigns. One key feature is its image preview, which quickens retrieval time. Many companies buy their images in the EPS format due to the immense resize potential it contains.
How to convert the JPG to EPS
It should be pointed out that there are a few roundabout ways to get your JPGs into EPS files, but these are not direct and don’t accomplish the true nature of this conversion. Therefore, I’m only going to go over the most direct, easy ways to convert, which give us the most effective result. There are two different ways to pull this off. The first method involves using a browser-based converter, which is a system that requires no installation before use. This type of process requires only a competent internet connection and enough hard drive space to handle new file downloads. I recommend Convertio due to their fast system and simple interface.
The second conversion method is for users who need a large quantity of files converted all at once. Note that, unlike the browser-based systems, this method requires a large amount of hard drive space. However, it doesn’t necessitate any sort of internet access once the program is installed to the computer. If you want to convert in bulk, I recommend using Image Converter Plus due to its useful features and simplistic tools.
What are the key benefits of converting?
The JPG is quite accessible, small in size and simplistic. Despite all this, It’s not perfect for every situation. Sometimes being basic is helpful, other times it’s a limitation. When this is the case, moving to a more complex file type makes the most sense. In this particular situation, the EPS gives users a more detailed format to explore and potentially edit. One of the most common reasons users need the EPS extension is when they want to import an image into a print project. Another great thing about the EPS is it’s easily editable within Adobe Illustrator, a powerful graphics tool.
The JPG is a smaller, low-resolution file type, making it great to share with other users, at least in terms of how quick it can send. However, this is just the surface-level of sharing. When it comes to more in-depth projects, it’s important to have other file type options for images. This way, if a fellow team member requests something in another file, such as the EPS, you’ll have a quick conversion method available to get the correct file type to them fast.
Overcome any potential JPG limitations by knowing all the different ways to convert it to an EPS. Sooner or later you’ll find a situation that requires it – make sure you have the process down perfectly."
176,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-jpg-to-indd/,"Should you convert from JPG to INDD? How is it possible?
May 1, 2020|
The JPG is a pretty simple, common image format, while the INDD is a bit more complicated. As a result, converting the JPG to the INDD can be a bit complex. However, it doesn’t have to be. This article shows you how simple this process really is when it’s broken down step-by-step. Here’s the quickest, most efficient ways to make this conversion, starting with a rundown of these two image types.
What is the JPG?
The JPG image file is a highly-popular graphics format that is accessible and medium-sized. It’s the Joint Photographic Experts Group official file format. The JPG uses lossy compression, which is why it’s generally not too large in size. Lossy means it loses resolution as it reduces in overall size. The most important thing to remember about the JPG is that it’s interchangeable with the JPEG format.
What is the INDD?
The InDesign file extension, or INDD, is the standard format for Adobe InDesign projects. It’s commonly used by companies to create different design elements like page data and layouts. It’s great for print layouts especially, such as newspapers and flyers. INDD isn’t as editable as the PSD in terms of graphic design, but it does have a lot of features that stand out.
How to convert the JPG to INDD
If you’re a beginner looking for the quickest way to make this conversion, using a browser-based automated system is best. Simply upload a JPG onto the site, then download it in the INDD format. This is great for anyone without access to Adobe InDesign. I recommend using Convertio, which has a fast and direct JPG converter to switch files over to INDD. Its interface is simple and doesn’t require any technical knowledge, either.
The other option is best-suited for users who have access to Adobe InDesign and have a little more technical know-how. This isn’t a direct conversion, but the end result is essentially the same. First, launch the Adobe InDesign software. Next, import the JPG file. Once the JPG is placed inside the INDD, simply save the INDD file and you’ll have the JPG image in INDD form.
Why is this conversion necessary?
The JPG is a pretty popular, accessible image file. How come then, anyone would want to switch over to a different format? One explanation is the JPG is a pretty basic format, leaving a lot to be desired for advanced users with a lot of different tasks to complete with their graphics. Moving off the JPG might also be a tactical decision based on the fact it’s often confused with JPEG. For example, maybe someone needs to share a JPG with many different users, it might be better for it to be in a different format to not confuse anyone.
Another reason converting from JPG to INDD makes sense is due to the benefits of using InDesign for things like editing and building professional projects. This is especially true when someone is working on a company campaign. It’s also beneficial for users who have extensive technical knowledge and thorough understanding of Adobe products.
Remember to, most of all, take into account both the productivity the JPG is providing and how convenient it is when it comes to sharing and storing. This could save plenty of future time and resources."

December 1, 2019|
The NEF has such beautiful, high resolution that it begs the question: can you convert other image files into it? I’ll go over the answer to this, specifically when it comes to the JPG. Here’s an in-depth guide.
What is a JPG?
The JPG image file is the file extension representing the Joint Photographic Experts Group. The JPG is interchangeable with the JPEG image file. The JPG is easily shareable because of how accessible it is. It’s also simple to download because of its small size. Finally, it’s extremely popular and uses lossy compression, which means it loses quality as it shrinks in size.
What is a NEF?
The NEF image file is a raw image file that represents a photograph from a Nikon camera. Anytime someone takes a photo using a Nikon and then downloads it to a computer, it’s put into the NEF format. It is high in resolution and has every single detail from the original photograph from which it came. Most people who use NEF files end up converting them in order to edit and share them more freely.
Is it possible to convert a JPG to NEF?
You’ve probably already probed the web for a way to convert the JPG to NEF and came up with no solutions. What’s the reason for this? Unfortunately, it’s not possible to convert the JPG to NEF. It seems like there would be a lot of good reasons to make this conversion, though it’s actually not necessary. In fact, the JPG is already in the correct format for most tasks you would need to complete with a NEF file.
The NEF is the genesis of an editing process. It’s the most basic file, a total representation of a high resolution photo.To explain it better, the NEF is the beginning product of a cycle. It is the initial creation. In order to use the NEF further, it needs to be changed into a different file type. Something like JPG is a capable candidate, making this the end result of the process. Once converted, the new JPG file is more editable and shareable. It’s also better for building and creating websites using photos.
How to convert NEF to JPG
Now, even though it’s impossible to convert the JPG to NEF, doesn’t mean the inverse won’t work. In fact, it’s quite simple and there’s a lot of ways to do it. Just so you’re aware, the reason to convert NEF to JPG is the NEF is simply a raw representation of a photograph. It’s raw and meant to be a point of reference rather than a functional file type. The JPG, on the other hand, is designed to be shared and edited, as it’s more accessible and smaller in size. Here’s how to convert from NEF to JPG:
The first way is through a manual conversion. This way is much better for users who have a lot of files they want converted all at once and have limited to no internet access. First, open the Nikon software browser, then open the folder with the images you want converted. Select all the files you wish to be converted (at the same time) and select ‘Save As’ from the file menu. Choose to save them as a JPG (JPEG).
The other way to convert is by using a third-party software, in particular a web-based program. These are great for users who have fast internet access, only a few files to convert and limited hard drive space. I recommend Convertio, a fast program with a simple interface.
Even though it’s not possible to convert the JPG to NEF, you wouldn’t want to anyway. In fact, you might want the exact opposite someday. If that’s the case, just follow the above steps and you’ll be fine."
178,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-jpg-to-orf/,"Is there a way to convert the JPG image file to an ORF?
February 6, 2020|
In theory, converting the JPG to the ORF should be beneficial to users who want a high resolution image. Unfortunately, things don’t always work out the way they seem. Is it possible to make this conversion? If not, what are some alternatives? Let’s first breakdown both the JPG and ORF.
What is a JPG?
The JPG image file is a lossy compression format, meaning it loses quality the smaller that it is reduced in size. There’s typically confusion as to how the JPG differs from the JPEG image file. In fact, they are the same and only different in acronym/name. Feel free to use them completely interchangeably throughout this article. The JPG is an extremely accessible image file with plenty of versatility.
What is the ORF?
The ORF image file is the official digital format for all pictures that are transferred from an Olympus camera onto a computer. ORF stands for Olympus Raw Image File. It is a high quality, raw representation of the exact picture the photographer snapped on an Olympus camera. Though this replication has its merit, the file lacks accessibility and editability.
Now that we have given a background for the JPG and the ORF, let’s dive into the conversion possibilities.
How to convert the JPG to the ORF?
The JPG is on the lower end of image format quality. For this reason, it makes sense that users want to convert it to an image type that is more capable of handling higher resolution. Eventually, the idea of converting it to an ORF could come into play, as the ORF is extremely high quality. Unfortunately, this conversion isn’t possible and here’s why. The ORF is an exclusive digital file for images from a specific camera. Files in the ORF format are in their initial stages of a process, meaning they’re waiting to be converted into a different format for editing and sharing. That all being said, the good news is that you don’t really want to convert the JPG to the ORF anyway – it just doesn’t make sense logically.
The JPG is already in an ideal format for things such as editing and sharing, two things that are difficult to accomplish using an ORF file. Even though the JPG is lower in resolution, that’s one of the trade-offs that sometimes come with accessibility and versatility. If you absolutely need to convert out of the JPG, consider switching to other popular, similar image files like the PNG. Finally, if you have an ORF file and you want to convert it to a JPG, this is indeed possible.
How to convert the ORF to JPG
Unlike converting the JPG to the ORF, the reverse conversion is possible. It’s fairly straightforward so long as you’re willing to use third-party programs. There are two different ways to accomplish this conversion, both with drastically different advantages and drawbacks. The first way is a bulk, system converter. It’s called a bulk converter because it handles a lot of files at once. This type of conversion is great for users with extensive hard drive space and limited internet access. All it requires is an initial download of a program followed by an installation. I recommend the PearlMountain system when it comes to bulk converting.
The other method is a browser-based conversion which lets users navigate to a website and upload then download files. This process is ideal for users who have limited hard drive space but fast internet access. It’s also convenient for anyone who only needs to convert a few files. I recommend Zamzar when you need a browser-based conversion.
In the end, if you have JPG files you wish to convert to ORF, it’s just not possible. Fortunately, this particular conversion is illogical and there are a lot of superior choices. Make sure you have some alternative image types in mind."

October 9, 2019|
The JPG is a small, convenient image file perfect for sharing in large quantities and saving hard drive space. However, It has a few issues that restrict it. One of these issues is a lack of strong resolution. When this becomes an issue for a project, consider converting to a PNG. Here’s how.
What is a JPG?
The JPG image file is a popular file type due to its incredibly small size. The JPG compression ensures it is a manageable size, however, this also lowers the resolution quality of images. It’s typically used when dealing with large quantities of images.
The lossy compression (compression that forces files to lose image quality) makes JPG a bad option for things like important, untouched photographs. It does, on the other hand, make it easy for users to share and store a lot of different image files quickly and efficiently.
What is a PNG?
The PNG image file is a very high resolution Portable Network Graphic image. PNG uses lossless compression, meaning that when it reduces in size, it maintains the quality of the original graphic entirely. It is typically used to store graphics on websites.
The PNG is easy to open in both Windows and Mac, making it a fairly popular file choice. It also handles things like photography projects and website building well. It often is converted to a smaller file size when editing.
How to convert JPG to PNG
There’s no third-party software required to convert a JPG to a PNG. Simply follow these simple steps:
Using Windows
- Locate the JPG file you wish to convert on your system
- Right-click it and select ‘edit’
- In the Paint app, select ‘file’ then ‘save as’
- Using the ‘save as type’ dropdown menu, choose ‘PNG’
- Save the file to the location of your choice
Using Mac
- Open the JPG file using Preview
- Under ‘file’ select ‘save as’
- Choose the ‘PNG’ option from the dropdown menu
Lastly, if neither of these options appeal to you, there’s always browser-based systems. They do require you to upload and download images, which can be a privacy concern. If this is the route you wish to take, Convertio has an easy interface and fast uploads.
Additional considerations
The PNG is a large file – much less manageable than the JPG. If at some point you wish to convert back from the PNG to JPG, that is also possible. The above steps for both Windows and Mac work when substituting the two image file types. This is usually necessary when creating a library of image files that require previews. The JPG is a smaller file type that can display the previews with minimal lag.
If you’re worried about image quality, the JPG might not be the best option for you. Consider the PNG, especially if drive space isn’t a big concern."

May 11, 2020|
The JPG is one of the easiest-to-use, popular image formats available. The PSD is a little more complicated and lesser-used. Chances are, these two different image types will eventually overlap. When the time comes for you to convert the JPG to PSD, make sure you understand the different available methods. Here’s a guide to fully prepare you.
What is the JPG image file?
The JPG image file is essentially a clone of the JPEG. They are 100% interchangeable, making the JPG also the official file extension for the Joint Photographic Experts Group. The JPG is a highly accessible image format, as it is easy for users to open it with different systems. Finally, it’s a lossy compression file type, meaning it experiences at least some amount of quality loss as it reduces in size.
What is the PSD image file?
The PSD image file is the official file format used for projects saved using the Adobe Photoshop system. PSD (PhotoShop Document) is capable of holding numerous images within a single project. It is an extremely edit-friendly image type, due to the fact that Photoshop was designed with graphics users in mind.
What are some of the main reasons to make this conversion?
Let’s begin with the JPG side of things. For starters, the JPG is fairly limited in terms of functionality. Note that this is different from accessibility, which is how easy the file is for many different users to open. Functionality, however, is a measurement of all the different ways in which a user can manipulate a file. So, it stands to reason that there are going to be users who prefer their image in a different format so they can do more with it. This is where the PSD comes in handy.
The PSD is one of the most sophisticated editing files, especially helpful for graphic designers who need extensive features. Compared to JPG in particular, there are huge editing and features advantages to consider. When you also take into account the fact that most advanced designers are well-versed in Adobe Photoshop, the reason to convert from JPG to PSD becomes a lot clearer. With this in mind, let’s take a look at how to convert.
How to convert from JPG to PSD
Now that we have some good reasons on why this conversion makes so much sense, here’s how to do it. First, recognize that if you have access to Adobe products, this process is so much easier. We’ll go over what you need to do if you don’t have Adobe software, but first let’s give the most direct conversion approach. Keep in mind that this isn’t necessarily a conversion as much as it’s simply importing a file and then saving it as a different file format. To start, launch Photoshop and import the JPG file you wish to convert. Now, simply save your project and the original image will now be in PSD format.
The next conversion method is needed if you don’t have access to Adobe Photoshop. First, make sure you have enough hard drive space to download a few PSD files. They won’t be much bigger than the JPG. You’ll now simply use a browser-based conversion system to switch files over. I recommend Convertio, a longtime conversion tool with fast speeds and simple functions. All it requires is a web browser so that you can upload and download the file to and from the Convertio system.
Most users find the JPG to be sufficient in most image format projects. The most overlooked issue, however, is that their fellow team members might not share the same views. This is why it’s always a plus to know how to convert, just in case."
181,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-jpg-to-tiff/,"A comprehensive guide to convert JPG to TIFF
November 3, 2019|
The JPG is one of the most basic image file types available, making it a very popular choice. However, it often lacks capabilities that only niche file extensions have. When this stands in the way of your progress, it’s time to consider converting. The TIFF is a complex image format that a lot of users benefit from. Learn how and why to convert from JPG to TIFF.
What is a JPG?
The JPG image file is a lossy compression file type, meaning that it is capable of reducing in size but this reduction brings with it loss of resolution. The JPG is interchangeable with the JPEG, as they’re both the standard for the Joint Photographic Experts Group. It is a highly editable file.
What is a TIFF?
The TIFF image file is the tagged image file format, a high securely image extension. It’s used only in specific situations in which users need enhanced security on a graphic file. The TIFF stores extensive metadata inside each image file, allowing users the ability to gather information about a picture before opening it.
How to convert using Windows
It’s fortunately pretty easy to convert a JPG to a TIFF using Windows, especially if you only have a small amount of files you need converted. Here’s how:
- Locate the JPG file you wish to convert
- Right-click the file
- Select ‘edit’ or select ‘open with’ > ‘paint’
- In the Paint image, click the ‘file’ menu and click ‘save as’
- In the dropdown box, select TIFF
- Name the file and choose your location
How to convert using Mac
- Locate the JPG file you need to convert
- Using ‘Preview’, choose ‘file’ then ‘export’
- From the selection, choose TIFF
- Click ‘save’
If neither of these options suit you, there’s always third party conversion programs. These are ideal for users who wish to convert a large amount of files all at once. If you’re in need of conversion software, consider Zamzar, a browser-based system, for their simple interface and fast upload and download speeds.
Why convert?
The JPG is a very common file type that covers a wide range of functions and user needs. However, it’s just too basic to handle specific tasks that only things like the TIFF are capable of doing. Even though the TIFF is larger than the JPG, it’s compression abilities make up for the size. If needed, it can shrink without losing resolution.
The main reason to convert to TIFF is the overall safety features. The JPG just doesn’t measure up to the security of TIFF, particularly because of its transparency. The TIFF lets users evaluate a photo without having to open it. This prevents potential viruses and other security issues from occurring.
How to reverse the process
If you’ve made a mistake and wish to revert your TIFF file back to a JPG, the process is very similar. The above steps are the same, only switch TIFF with JPG and vice-versa when necessary. Similarly, there’s third party software to accommodate the reversal as well. In fact, Zamzar, the browser-based service, is capable of converting TIFF to JPG. Knowing how to convert back is important if you’re converting in bulk, since sometimes you’ll end up converting a file you didn’t wish to.
The JPG has mostly everything a user could ever want from an image file. Unfortunately, sometimes it’s not enough. The TIFF has so many unique features, it’s inevitable a user will choose it. When this is the case, make sure you understand how to convert."

December 25, 2019|
At some point you’ll realize that you want to convert an image file in order to be more accessible, editable and shareable. When that time comes, it’s best to be prepared and understand all the basics. If you’ve used NEF files extensively, you’ll know they lack a lot of basic functionality that other image file types have. This probably has led you to want to convert. If you’re unsure of how to convert and you have the idea of switching to the CR2, this guide is for you.
What is a NEF?
The NEF image file is a digital file used for handling Nikon Camera photographs on a computer. NEF therefore stands for Nikon Electronic Format. The NEF retains the entire resolution of the original photograph. It’s standard for users to convert the NEF when they need something more capable of editing and sharing.
What is a CR2?
The CR2 image file is the digital file format that is a result of any images pulled from a Canon camera and downloaded to a computer. CR2 stands for Canon Raw 2, indicating second edition. They’re high in resolution and large in size, showing a raw, exact replication of every photograph snapped. The CR2 typically needs to be converted when it’s time to edit it.
How to convert NEF to CR2
Whatever predicament you’ve gotten yourself into, trying to convert the NEF to a CR2, know this: it’s not possible or even logical to try. Let me explain so this is clear. The NEF is a file used for bringing Nikon camera photographs onto the computer. The CR2 is the exact same thing, only for Canon cameras. Trying to convert one to the other is the same as converting a magazine into print format – it’s already in print!
So, what is the alternative? Well, there’s plenty. You first need to figure out what you’re converting for. More space? Smaller file? Better editing? Based on your answers, this should narrow down what type of file you’re looking for. Start with some of the basic image file types and see if any of them would accomplish what you need done. Image files such as JPEG, GIF and PNG are great starting points.
Is the reverse conversion possible?
If you’re wondering whether the opposite conversion, CR2 to NEF, might work, unfortunately it’s the same. It won’t work because you’re trying to convert two similar file types into one another. The CR2 needs to be converted into file types that are different and more accessible by other programs.
If you need to convert the CR2 into a common image file type, there are a few ways to go about doing it. The first is to use a browser-based converter system, which lets you navigate to a webpage, upload your CR2 files and then download them in the format of your choice. The second method involves downloading and installing a converter. This is great for users who have limited internet access. All that’s left is for you to decide what type of file you wish to convert to.
If you were hoping to convert the NEF to CR2, don’t be disappointed – knowledge is power! You can now find an alternative and be more informed for the future when this comes up."

April 24, 2020|
The NEF provides a way for physical photographs to download onto a computer without sacrificing the original resolution. It’s a great starting point for digital photos, but it’s generally not used past the initial computer transfer. If you need a strong alternative, the EPS offers a lot of benefits. This article explains how to convert the NEF to EPS. First, let’s review the NEF and EPS file types.
What is the NEF image file?
The NEF image file is a raw digital photo from Nikon. Anytime a picture is taken on a Nikon camera and uploaded to a computer, it’s in the NEF format. The NEF (Nikon Electronic Format) is an exact replication of the original photograph, completely unchanged in quality. It’s a very common image extension for professional photographers. Most users typically convert to a different image file type when they want to edit the NEF. However, the Nikon program Capture NX-D has some basic editing tools.
What is the EPS image file?
The EPS image file is a professional digital picture format, common among companies who need to manage numerous branding images, such as logos. It’s a popularly purchased file type because of how customizable and resizable it is after the purchase. The EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) is a highly accessible tool, easy to open for both Windows and Mac users.
What are the best ways to convert the NEF to EPS?
Converting from the NEF to EPS isn’t possible using the Nikon Capture NX-D software. However, there are alternatives, starting with an automated converter. A browser-based converter, for example, lets users upload their NEF files then download them in EPS format. This method is ideal for anyone with high-speed internet access or limited hard drive space. I highly recommend using Convertio as your go-to browser-based conversion tool. It’s a fast system with an efficient layout.
The other conversion method is a system-based tool, which is more helpful to anyone with limited internet speeds or access. It’s also a good choice for users with a lot of hard drive space. If you’re looking to convert a large number of NEF files to EPS all at once, a batch system is the right option. I’ve particularly enjoyed the effectiveness of reaConverter whenever I need bulk file changes. All it requires is internet access for the initial download. After that, you’ll simply need enough space to install it and store the converted files.
Why is this conversion important?
As you know, the NEF exists in the raw file format, free of any quality downgrades. It also has limited capabilities, especially concerning accessibility, editing functionality and sharing. Not many programs are capable of opening an NEF. Unless you use the Capture NX-D, it’s going to take some digging to find one to open the NEF. Though Capture NX-D gives some editing tools, it’s not all that comprehensive. The NEF is also tough to share because of how large it is.
So, why would it be beneficial to switch over to the EPS file type? The most important reasons lie in the fact that the EPS acts in an opposite manner of the NEF. For starters, the EPS is extremely resizable and easy to edit. Also, it’s a lot more accessible, giving users a way to instantly and easily open their stored image files. Finally, it’s a lot easier to share, both in file size and convenience.
No matter how much you prefer the NEF file over other images, be prepared for the inevitability that you’ll need to convert it at some point. The reality is it lacks crucial benefits that prevent it from being used by many different users."
184,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-nef-to-jpg/,"How to convert your NEF files to JPG image types
February 13, 2020|
The NEF gives users a chance to see the original intention of photographers – a full vision of their images in a digital format. Unfortunately, when it comes time to share these files, they’re quite large. When it’s time to share or edit them, you’ll want to convert the NEF files into a JPG. Here’s a breakdown of how to accomplish this, starting with a quick rundown of the two file types.
What is a NEF file?
The NEF image file is the digital format for any image files taken using a Nikon camera and then uploaded to a computer. NEF is an acronym meaning Nikon Electronic Format. It is a digital file that upholds the exact representation of the photographed image without any quality or resolution loss. The end result of an NEF is likely conversion into a different file type, due to its limited editing versatility, lack of accessibility and excessive size.
What is a JPG file?
The JPG image file is one of the most popular image types available, especially when you consider it and the JPEG are one and the same. The JPG is the Joint Photographic Experts Group extension. The acronym fits with JPEG, which is interchangeable completely with the JPG. The JPG is very accessible and reasonably sized. It’s also a lossy compression file, meaning it loses quality as it’s reduced in size.
How to convert the NEF to JPG?
Unfortunately, the software that is assigned to the NEF files by Nikon is limited in both its editing and conversion capabilities. It is possible to convert the NEF to a TIFF using the Nikon software but this isn’t our intention. We want a wider range of conversions, particularly to the JPG. For this, we will have to make an automated conversion using third-party software tools.
There are two different ways to do this. The first method involves using a browser-based service. This is ideal for users who only want to convert a few files at a time. It’s also great for anyone with limited hard drive space and fast internet speeds. I recommend using Zamzar for browser-based conversions due to its quick downloads and simple interface. The next type of conversion involves downloading and installing a program to your system. This allows users with a lot of extra hard drive space to make conversions, including converting a lot of files at once. This method is great for users with limited internet access. I recommend Imageconverterplus for these system-based conversions.
Why make this conversion?
As you know, the NEF retains all the resolution of the original photograph. This makes the file very large in size. A large file size has a lot of negative aspects, including slow upload and downloading speeds and difficulty finding hard drive space to store. It also creates annoyances for anyone who you share the file with, as they are forced to download such a large file. Converting to the JPG creates a much more manageable file size.
Another concern with the NEF is the software tools dedicated to it are lacking in versatility. They can edit on a small scale but don’t have the full range of editing tools that other systems have. Converting to the JPG allows for use within numerous editing systems, giving users a chance to make extensive edits relatively easily.
The NEF definitely serves a purpose and has its own value. At the end of the day, though, it’s just not practical to accomplish the many things modern digital images are capable of. Make sure you have a good plan in place to convert it when necessary."
185,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-nef-to-orf/,"How to convert the NEF image file to an ORF image file
April 14, 2020|
The NEF and ORF image files both result from different cameras, making them unique and for very specific uses. At some point, while working with these files, you’ll probably want to convert them into a different format for easier accessibility. If you’re attempting to convert the NEF into an ORF, this article is for you. I’ll walk you through everything you need to know concerning this conversion and other potential options. Let’s begin with a quick rundown of both the NEF and ORF file types.
What is a NEF image file?
The NEF image file is the standard digital format resulting from a picture that was taken using a Nikon camera (NEF stands for Nikon Electronic Format). The NEF is a raw image, meaning it is without any editing or manipulation. It is a high quality replication of the exact image that the photographer took using their camera. Because of how specific the NEF is, it’s typical for users to convert the file into a different image format at some point.
What is an ORF image file?
The ORF image file is the digital result of any picture that was taken on an Olympus camera (ORF stands for Olympus Raw Image File) then uploaded to a computer. It has very limited editing and sharing potential, being such a large, inaccessible file. Similar to the NEF, most ORF users eventually prefer to convert the ORF to a different file type for convenience.
Now let’s take a look at how to convert these files into one another, as well as some potential alternative options.
How do I convert the NEF to an ORF?
Here’s where things get rather tricky. The NEF and the ORF are both very similar files, image file types that result from a specific camera brand. In fact, they both share the same purpose as digital files. NEF and ORF exist in order to act as conduit from a physical camera to a digital computer. Because of this, they don’t convert into one another.
We’ll explain some alternatives, but first it’s important to give you a detailed visual representation of why the NEF won’t convert to the ORF. Think of image file formats like the color of a car. If you have a red car and want it blue, it can be painted to make it so. However, if you have an old Honda but want a lamborghini, no amount of paint job will make this happen. This is essentially the ORF and NEF. It’s possible to convert them into other formats, just not each other.
Is the inverse conversion possible? Alternatives?
As explained above, since the ORF and NEF are essentially the exact same file type, they don’t convert into one another. Therefore, the inverse conversion (ORF into NEF) won’t work either. However, there are some alternatives depending on what you would like to do with your files. If you’re trying to convert the NEF because you don’t know how to edit it, consider Nikon’s flagship NEF-editing software, Capture NX-D. It has a lot of different tools that give users a chance to make changes to their professional photos.
However, if you’re looking for more functionality and editing capability, it’s probably best to convert the NEF into a more manageable image format. The quickest and easiest way to do this is by using an automated converter, available as a browser-based system. All it requires is an internet connection and enough hard drive space to download a new file. I recommend Convertio due to its quick downloads and intuitive interface.
If you’re disappointed by not being able to convert the NEF to the ORF, there’s really no need to be. This conversion wouldn’t really benefit you, and there are plenty of different, more efficient ways to get the job done."

January 31, 2020|
The NEF is a fantastic way to give creators a digital representation of their real life photography. However, it’s not without limitations. When it comes time to edit and share the NEF, it falls a little flat. Fortunately there are ways to overcome this. One such way is by a conversion. Here’s all you need to know to convert the NEF to a PNG.
What is a NEF?
The NEF image file is a digital format that is the result of a photograph snapped using any model of a Nikon camera. NEF stands for Nikon Electronic Format. It is a raw file that maintains all of the resolution from the original image without any quality loss. The NEF is hard to edit, making it a likely conversion candidate.
What is a PNG?
The PNG image file is a popular, easy-to-use, accessible graphic format that is a raster image. Raster images construct images through detailed designations for different photo sections. The PNG is a lossless file, which indicates it retains its quality and resolution during resizing and compressing.
How to convert the NEF to PNG
The NEF files unfortunately don’t come with comprehensive digital software that allows users to convert it to a wide range of files. Instead, you’ll need to make an automated conversion using a third-party program. Luckily, this is really easy to do. The most important part of the process is making sure you pick the right type of program. I’ve made it really simple for you by explaining both as follows: there is a system-based converter and a browser-based converter. Let’s start with the system-based converter. This type of program is best for users who have abundant hard drive space, as it stores onto your computer and generally is for anyone with a lot of files to convert. It’s also better for anyone with limited internet access, because it doesn’t require a connection to use after installation. An example of one of these converter types is the PearlMountain system, which allows for fast conversions of numerous files at once.
Your other option, if the previous one didn’t suffice, is a browser-based converter. These systems work well for anyone who has a fast internet connection and only a few files to convert. It doesn’t require any installation but instead lets users download and upload files directly. If a user has minimal hard drive space to spare, a browser-based system is perfect. One such converter is Zamzar, a fast program with a simple interface. Now that you have a way to make your conversion, it’s important you understand why it’s necessary to convert.
Why convert the NEF to PNG?
The NEF is typically the beginning product of a process rather than a completed one. It is great in the sense that it shows the exact replication of the photographer’s work but this is the extent of its purpose. When it comes time to do other things, it needs to be much more versatile. This is when it becomes time to convert it. The next question is the equation becomes what do I convert it to?
If you want a file that’s easy to share and edit, the PNG makes a lot of sense. The PNG is simply a lot more accessible than the NEF. A lot of different programs, including common ones, open the PNG without issue. This of course makes it easier to share as well, since the recipient will be able to open it easier. Finally, the NEF just isn’t easy to edit without a conversion. When it’s in the form of a PNG, users can edit it with a wide range of different editing software tools.
It would be nice to retain all of our digital images in the raw, NEF format. However, it’s just not very practical. We would run out of hard drive space quickly and any clients we send them to would be annoyed. When it’s time to convert, make sure you have the right tools to get the job done."
187,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-nef-to-psd/,"How do I convert a NEF to a PSD? The ultimate guide
November 10, 2019|
For photographers and clients of photographers, the value of a NEF cannot be understated. It contains the true, unaltered vision of the original image. However, it’s very tough to edit and store. When it’s time to touch it up a bit, you’ll need to convert it into a PSD. Here’s everything you need to know about how to convert a NEF to PSD.
What is a NEF?
The NEF image file is the file format for all photos taken from a Nikon camera and uploaded to a computer. NEF stands for Nikon Electronic Format. A NEF retains with precision every detail of a photographed image without losing any quality. The NEF is seldom-used outside of a few basic operations as it’s large and difficult to edit.
What is a PSD?
The PSD image file is the file format for image files saved within the Adobe Photoshop software. PSD stands for Photoshop Document. It’s capable of containing different aspects of images, including numerous images. A PSD Is great for extensive editing, resizing and manipulation.
How to convert
There’s fortunately a lot of different options when converting a NEF to PSD. The first and most convenient option is to use the Adobe Photoshop program. In order to convert this way, make sure you know the location of the PSD file on your computer. Open your Photoshop program and then open the PSD file you wish to convert. Then, save the file as a PSD.
If you don’t have Photoshop or are temporarily without access to it, there are a couple alternative ways to convert. First, you can use a browser-based converter. This is a great option for users who need only a few files converted. It’s also great when hard drive space is limited. Consider Convertio to handle your browser-based conversions. It’s a convenient, trusted program that has fast upload speeds.
The third and final option comes in the form of a conversion program that you install on your computer. This works best for users who have a lot of hard drive space and can store large quantities of large files on their system. It’s also ideal when you need to convert a lot of files all at once. Furthermore, users who have limited internet access benefit greatly from having the converter on their own system. The PearMountain Image Converter is a great option for users looking to convert a lot of files at once.
Why convert the NEF to PSD?
The NEF is a high resolution image taken in its rawest form from camera to computer. Even though it’s beneficial to have the original quality file to examine all of the photographer’s important details, it’s unfortunately not in a position to be edited extensively.
When it’s time to edit NEF, it needs to be in a format that is highly editable. Because it’s a raw image, it hasn’t been doctored. It’s safe to assume that the image has a lot of potential edits in its future. Therefore, it’s important to convert it to something capable of extensive editing. This is why the PSD makes so much sense. Photoshop gives users numerous tools to create a variety of different graphic details.
The NEF is such a beautiful image file, it’s hard to imagine shrinking it down or messing with its original purity. However, it’s just too large to store in large quantities. When you need a smaller file size on your system, convert the NEF to a PSD."
188,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-nef-to-tiff/,"A guide to convert the NEF image file to a TIFF
March 12, 2020|
The NEF offers a beautiful resolution of any picture snapped on a Nikon camera. Though there are software tools to manage this file format, chances are you’ll want to convert it at some point anyway. Here’s a guide to convert the NEF to TIFF.
What is the NEF image file?
The NEF image file is the default image format for a picture taken using a Nikon camera. NEF stands for Nikon Electronic Format and is a raw image. This means that it is completely untouched by editing or digital changes – it is an exact replica of the original photo. Users typically like to convert the NEF file into a more manageable file type.
What is a TIFF image file?
The TIFF image file is a raster image format which is capable of storing extensive metadata in each file. TIFF stands for Tagged Image File Format. It is a highly secure file extension, perfectly-designed for anyone who has private and sensitive images. The TIFF is highly-accessible, as it’s easily-opened by a lot of different programs on numerous operating systems.
How to convert the NEF to TIFF
There is currently a powerful software program from Nikon called the Capture NX-D. This system allows users to edit and organize NEF files. More importantly, it lets users save their NEF files as TIFF. To perform this function, locate the ‘Convert Files’ button on your Capture NX-D toolbar. It’s the far-right icon that looks like a document with a magnifying glass over it. In the popup window, click the ‘File format’ menu and select ‘TIFF’. Fill in the other options based on your preferences, then hit the ‘Start’ button.
If you want an alternate conversion method other than the Capture NX-D, there are browser-based systems you can use. These do require an extra step and an internet connection. The NX-D should be your preferred method, though these browser programs work in a pinch. I recommend Convertio due to its fast speeds and easy-to-use interface.
Why make this conversion?
The most important and common reason to convert the NEF to a TIFF is the editing potential. The Capture NX-D does allow for a little bit of editing, though it doesn’t satisfy users who need extensive image changes. Converting to a TIFF is prudent for editing purposes, as the file can then be opened using programs such as Adobe Photoshop, which are ideal for editing and making changes.
Another reason users consider this conversion is it makes their image file more accessible and shareable. Chances are, sharing NEF files with clients and fellow team members will run into the problem of accessibility on the receiver’s end. The TIFF, on the other hand, likely won’t have this issue. Furthermore, sharing a TIFF file is a lot easier, considering the size is a lot more manageable.
Just because you want to convert your NEF files doesn’t mean they’re obsolete. In fact, converting to the TIFF typically splits your image library and allows for different types of sharing and storage. When the time comes to shift your NEF to a different file type, make sure you know how to do it quickly and efficiently."
189,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-orf-to-ai/,"How to convert from the ORF to the AI
April 20, 2020|
The ORF is a file type photographers love to use, to a certain extent. When it’s time to share images with others or edit them in-depth, these photographers realize the ORF won’t cut it. If this is something you’re dealing with and you need a real solution, this guide will handle everything. If you tried to convert the ORF to AI but didn’t know how, chances are you missed some basic methods. Before we get into those, here’s a quick description of both the ORF and AI.
What is an ORF image file?
The ORF image file is the official file extension for digital pictures that come from the Olympus camera. ORF (Olympus Raw Image File) has limited editing and sharing potential, due to its accessibility and large size. It is best suited for the Olympus Viewer program, the official Olympus software. Users typically convert the ORF when they need to edit it extensively.
What is an AI image file?
The AI image file is the official file extension used by the popular design software Adobe Illustrator. The AI uses vector graphics, which create the entirety of an image by hooking different points together. It is a completely resizable file that suffers no quality loss when shrunken. The most common use for AI files is building digital branding images, such as logos.
Different ways to convert the ORF to AI
There are a couple methods to convert our ORF files over to AI. The first way is for users who don’t have a lot of files to change. This method is the browser-based system, which allows for the uploading and downloading of individual files (as opposed to in bulk). All this requires is a serviceable internet connection and enough hard drive space to take on the new AI file. I recommend using Convertio for this conversion, due to how easy it is to use and how quickly it offers downloads.
The next method requires more hard drive space but doesn’t necessitate as fast of internet connection. The system-based conversion is done with a program that the user installs onto their personal computer. From there, they can convert a large quantity of image files all at once without any internet access. For this type of conversion, Filestar is an amazing option, as it provides a basic, unintrusive system for the less technically-inclined users.
What are the main reasons to convert?
The ORF has very limited potential in its original format. It is restricted to some basic editing within the Olympus Viewer tool. It’s also quite inaccessible, as most users are unable to open it without downloading and installing third party software (or making their own conversion!). Though this isn’t a huge issue if you plan on keeping the ORF file as-is and not share it, it’s clearly a problem for anyone wanting to do more with their images.
This is where the AI could really help users out as an alternative. With the AI format, users could make a lot more – and more effective – edits to their image. It would give them a chance to create a digital project that encompasses their original ORF image. On top of all this, it would also make sharing their image easier.
Now that you have some clear paths to convert the ORF to AI, take advantage of the different options available to share your images or include them into important projects."

December 31, 2019|
If you are a photographer or someone who works with a photographer and you have a lot of ORF files, you may have wondered if it’s possible to convert them to a different file type. In some cases, you might wonder if the CR2 would be an option. Is it possible to convert an ORF to a CR2 and is it logical to do so? This article explains everything.
What is the ORF image file?
The ORF image file is a raw graphic file extension which stands for Olympus Raw Image File. It’s the standard digital file format for all pictures snapped using an Olympus camera. Whenever somebody downloads images from their Olympus camera onto a computer, the file is automatically the ORF extension.
What is the CR2 image file?
The CR2 image file is the Canon Raw 2 (second edition). It is the standard file extension for any picture snapped on a Canon camera then downloaded onto a computer. It’s a very large file size because it’s the raw, detailed image the photographer snapped. It’s very high in resolution as well, which is nice to look at but tough to share.
Is it possible to convert the ORF to a CR2?
As you now know, both the ORF and the CR2 are raw camera files. They both serve similar purposes: acting as a way for photographers to get their pictures off their camera and onto their computer in a digital format. This of course means that they’re quite similar and do a lot of the same things. For that reason, converting one to the other makes little sense. Is it even possible though?
The bad news is that, no, it’s not possible to convert an ORF to a CR2. Think of this conversion like a magician whose big trick is turning one brand of bottled water into a different bottled water brand. No one would be impressed. Water is water. This is slightly different but the principle is the same. Converting ORF to a CR2 is like turning water into water. They are both raw camera images that need to be converted into common image file types in order to be edited and shared in bulk.
What are some alternatives?
Fortunately, there are some alternative ways to accomplish what you need accomplished with these image files. The first way is to use an editor that is capable of opening and changing the ORF. This way you don’t have to convert anything and you can still make changes to your image. Though this has some drawbacks, it doesn’t require any conversions of the initial file type.
The other thing you could do is convert the ORF to a different image file extension. It would probably be best to select a common file type that is not too bad and is easily edited. Something like JPG or PNG make a lot of sense here. There are different methods to convert as well. The first is a browser-based conversion, which allows users to quickly upload a file then download a new one in the intended format. The next method is a system-based conversion, which lets users convert multiple files at once from their computer without an internet connection. Whichever choice you prefer, make sure you convert to a file type that is compatible.
At the end of the day, some conversions just don’t make sense logically. Combine that with impossibility and it’s clear a re-routing is in order. In this case, the ORF can not and should not be converted to a CR2, so find a few image file types that you could use instead."
191,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-orf-to-jpg/,"How to convert the ORF image format into a JPG file
March 3, 2020|
The ORF has all the important characteristics that photographers want in a digital file – high resolution, exact replication of their original – but it lacks basic necessities. Luckily, there’s a solution to this, which involves changing the file format. Here’s a guide to help you learn how to convert the ORF to a JPG.
What is an ORF image file?
The ORF image file is a raw picture representing a photograph taken using an Olympus camera. ORF stands for Olympus Raw Image File. It is a very niche image extension, used only for a very few things. Users can open the ORF using Olympus Viewer, the standard Olympus software program. This allows for editing, though most users seek out alternative systems to find more extensive options.
What is a JPG image file?
The JPG image file is the Joint Photographic Experts Group official file. Though the acronym matches JPEG, these two are completely interchangeable, as you’ll see throughout the rest of this article. The JPG is very accessible, editable and shareable. It’s a popular image type due to how easy it is to open and share. Unfortunately, it uses lossy compression, meaning its small size comes with a price – weaker resolution.
How to convert the ORF to JPG
The Olympus Viewer allows us to make a manual conversion from ORF to JPG, though there are a few steps needed and some necessary explanation. The first thing to clear up is we can’t actually save to a JPG from Olympus Viewer, though we technically can. The Viewer only allows us to export to the JPEG, which, as I mentioned earlier, is interchangeable with the JPG. With that out of the way, begin the process by loading the ORF file you wish to convert into Olympus Viewer. Under the ‘File’ menu, select ‘Export’. In the window that appears, choose ‘JPEG’ in the ‘Format’ dropdown bar. Click ‘Save’ and you will now have a JPEG file (interchangeable with JPG).
If you want an alternate conversion method, there’s third-party systems that automate the process. All it requires is an internet connection and enough hard drive space to store the new JPG files you create (you can always delete the original ORF file to save more room). Navigate your browser to one of the many converters, upload your ORF file and then download your new JPG file. Convertio works really well for this process due to its quick speeds and simple interface.
Why should you convert an ORF to a JPG?
Chances are you enjoy a lot of things about the ORF format. It allowed you to digitize your entire collection without sacrificing any resolution. The issues that arise are typically its lack of accessibility and its overwhelming size. One problem the ORF has is it’s hard to open. Certainly for the original user, they’re likely to have Olympus Viewer. However, any future recipients of the file likely won’t. This creates an inconvenience to clients and other team members of projects. By converting to a JPG, you sacrifice some quality but ultimately allow more access to your work.
The large size of the ORF makes it very difficult to share. Even though internet speeds are much faster universally, a large ORF file could potentially take a very long time to download. Furthermore, when you consider that you might need to share your entire portfolio, it could end up taking hours to send and receive. The JPG is a much more conveniently-sized image file, giving you a chance to send your files quickly and easily.
The reality of images today is that they’re used in a practical sense digitally. Instead of admiration, they require practicality for things like website usage and sharing. Because of this, make sure you know how to convert your ORF files."

March 20, 2020|
The ORF and NEF file types are staples for photographers who use either of the Olympus and Nikon cameras extensively. There usually comes a time when these files need to be converted from their raw state. When this occurs, it’s important to have a solid understanding of your many different options. Here’s a guide to keep you informed.
What is the ORF image file?
The ORF image file is the digital format for photographs snapped using an Olympus camera. ORF is an acronym for Olympus Raw Format. It is a raw representation of the exact picture, in high resolution, downloaded to a computer for digital use. The Olympus Viewer software system handles most of the editing procedures, though it’s common for users to convert their ORF files in order to use different programs.
What is a NEF image file?
The NEF image file is a raw digital representation of any picture that is taken using a Nikon camera. NEF stands for Nikon Electronic Format. When a Nikon picture is transferred to a computer, the digital result is an exact duplicate of the original. Similar to the ORF, the NEF has its own flagship software system, the Nikon Capture NX-D, which allows users to edit NEF files.
Is it possible to convert the ORF to NEF?
The ORF and NEF are similar image file types. They are both the direct result of digital downloads from different cameras. Because of this, they’re not compatible to save as the other or convert to one another. However, you wouldn’t want or need to make this conversion anyway. The only reason one would want to use one of these files is to have some way to edit and digitally manage a group of images from the Olympus camera. Since the NEF offers no different features and all of the same restrictions, changing from ORF to NEF is pointless.
It stands to reason, then, that the NEF is also incapable of converting into the ORF. Again, the same principles apply both to the possibility and to the practicality of the matter. It should be pointed out that both of these camera digital files have a dedicated software system to better navigate editing and altering them. For the ORF, it’s the Olympus Viewer program. The NEF can be used in the Nikon Capture NX-D system. Now, even though these are both helpful programs which give you extensive editing options, it’s likely you’ll still need to make a conversion at some point. When this is the case, what are some alternative options?
What are some alternative solutions?
Now that it’s clear that we cannot convert ORF files into NEF, we should focus on alternatives to help with our editing and sharing processes. One possibility is to use the Olympus Viewer program to make our conversion. This gives us the option to convert to the following extensions: JPEG, TIFF and BMP. Determine which format best suits what you would like to do with your image files before making this conversion.
If you want to branch out and convert to a different file type, or you simply don’t have access to the Olympus Viewer at the moment, there are browser-based conversion programs that will suffice. Using a browser-based converter gives you the option of converting an ORF file into numerous file extensions, much wider-ranging than allowed in Viewer. The only requirements of a browser-based system is a fast internet and enough hard drive space to download a new file. I recommend using Convertio for this process, since it gives users a lot of different conversion options.
There’s no true way to convert the ORF to the NEF, though that doesn’t mean you’re helpless in the pursuit to edit and share these formats extensively. Find an alternative file type that works for you and use the above methods to convert it correctly."

January 29, 2020|
The ORF is a fantastic file to display perfect representations of a photographer’s vision. However, it’s just not realistic to use extensively across different projects. For this reason, it needs to be converted. Here’s how to convert the ORF to a PDF.
What is an ORF file?
The ORF image file is a camera file that has been downloaded to a computer for digital use. ORF stands for Olympus Raw image File. It is a raw file, meaning it is untouched and unaltered, an exact replica of the original photograph that was taken. It is very large in size and resolution, making it fairly difficult to share. It’s also tough to edit without third-party programs.
What is a PDF document?
The PDF document file is a file type that manages different printed documents efficiently. PDF stands for Portable Document Format. It is a file that allows users to search and view links within it. PDFs are capable of containing different media types such as audio and video. It’s a professional file format that allows users to send files without fear of the recipient accidentally editing them. It is considered a very secure file format.
How to convert the ORF to PDF
The ORF, like most camera-based files, doesn’t come with software programs that are equipped to convert it into different file types. Instead, you’ll need to find a third-party tool to make the conversion. There are two methods to consider. The first is by using a browser-based converter. This is ideal for users who have speedy internet access and limited hard drive space. It’s also great for anyone who only wants to convert a few files. I recommend Convertio for this process, as it’s extremely fast and easy-to-use.
If, however, browser-based conversions won’t work for you, there’s also a system-based conversion option. This type of conversion is for users who want to convert many files all at once. It’s also perfect for people who have limited internet access and abundant hard drive space. A system-based converter installs onto your system and then doesn’t require any further internet access to use. For this method, I recommend the program PearlMountain for its ideal interface for beginners.
Why convert?
As you may know, the ORF is only the initial part of the digitization process. It is like a bridge that connects photographers and their camera files to the digital realm. After crossing the bridge, there’s more work to be done. The ORF is so large in size and resolution that it is difficult to share. This is a negative, as most images in photographer’s collections are meant to be distributed, typically en-masse. Because of this, they need the file sizes to be manageable for their recipients. By converting the ORF to a smaller file type, they’re able to send them much easier. The ORF is also not very accessible or editable. This can be a pain to both the owner of the image files and any recipients. When converted to a different format, users are able to make edits much easier on their images. It should be pointed out that ORF files operate on Olympus Viewer, though this software program has limited capabilities in this regard.
Now, as to why a conversion to PDF makes sense, the PDF is a highly secure file type that is perfect for sharing – especially in a professional setting. By converting the ORF to a PDF, you’re making the file smaller, more accessible and better-suited to share in a professional environment. For example, if sharing some of your collected photographs with a potential client, it would look better on you to have the file type one that suits the client best.
It’s great to use the ORF when we want to see a digital format of a beautiful image. However, the practicality just doesn’t hold up. In the end, make sure you’re aware of how and why to convert the ORF into a PDF."
194,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-orf-to-png/,"How to convert the ORF to PNG and the benefits of doing so
February 24, 2020|
The ORF is a high resolution camera image file that is great for aesthetics but lacks practicality. The PNG, on the other hand, lacks some of the aesthetic greatness of ORF but makes up for it in the practical areas. When this negatively affects you, it’s time to convert the ORF to PNG. Here’s a guide explaining how to do so and the benefits you’ll receive. First, let’s break down both the ORF and PNG files for your better understanding.
What is an ORF image file?
The ORF image file is the standard digital format for all photographs snapped using an Olympus camera. ORF stands for Olympus Raw Image File. It is a way for photographers to digitize their catalog and create a potentially editable, shareable, searchable library of images. The ORF is a widely accessible extension due to the flagship software program it belongs to, Olympus Viewer. This program works for both Windows and Mac systems.
What is a PNG image file?
The PNG image file is a popular, accessible graphic format. PNG is an acronym for Portable Network Graphics. The PNG is particularly useful for those who need high quality images for editing and sharing. It is a raster image, which means it builds the entirety of its picture by bringing together different divided sections. These sections have assigned shades which construct the overall image.
How do you convert the ORF to PNG?
The Olympus Viewer is a very capable image system, allowing users to edit, organize and even convert their ORF files. However, it cannot save an ORF as a PNG (JPEG, TIFF and BMP are possible, however, in case you were curious). Because of this, there’s no possibility for a manual conversion, leaving automation as our only option. Fortunately, there’s plenty of different ways for automatic conversions.
The first way to convert the ORF to PNG is by using a browser-based conversion. This method is great for anyone who only needs a few images converted. It’s ideal for users with quick internet speeds and limited hard drive space. I recommend Convertio for its historical consistency, functionality and speed. Search around some if you don’t like the interface and setup of Convertio.
The other conversion option is a batch conversion, which requires a system-based tool (installed onto your system rather than browser-based). This suits users who have limited to no internet access. Once the tool is installed on your system, you needn’t access the internet to convert. It’s also great for anyone with extensive hard drive spice and numerous files to convert. I recommend PearlMountain for a system-based converter.
Why should you consider this conversion?
The ORF exists simply to bridge the gap between Olympus camera shots and the digital realm. Once this gap has been bridged, the ORF has served its purpose and can now be changed into a more useful file format. This is where the PNG comes in handy. Whereas the ORF is large in size and tough to edit extensively, the PNG is smaller and easy to edit.
Why are things like size and editability so important? Well, the reality of images is they’re now used for things such as websites, logos and other ways that cater to minimization. Though an ORF would look beautiful on a website, it would also slow the site down drastically. Switching to a PNG, though a reduction in quality, would be much more practical.
Unlike other popular camera digital file types, the ORF is quite accessible and has its own software system (Olympus Viewer). Though this gives it a leg up over other camera file formats (NEF, CR2, etc.), users will still run into a metaphorical wall when it comes to editing and sharing the ORF. Make sure you have a strong understanding of the conversion process for when this occurs."

October 13, 2019|
The PDF is a secure document extension that restricts editing capabilities. If this doesn’t suit you, it’s time to consider changing from PDF into a more editable file type. For a lot of projects, the AI is as perfect change of pace. Here’s how to convert the PDF to an AI.
What is a PDF?
The PDF document file or Portable Document Format is a file type that deals with printed documents. The PDF allows users to view links and search within a file. It is capable of holding multimedia like video and audio files. The PDF is a secure file format.
The PDF is one of the most popular document file types for companies to use due to its ability to capture multiple elements and share them. For example, say a project team member wanted to share a document with someone and the document included things like links, audio and images. The PDF would include all of these elements when sent to the recipient.
What is an AI?
The AI image file is the Adobe Illustrator file type that is a vector graphic format. Vector graphics are built using multiple points, which indicate image makeup. It is a scalable file that allows users to change its size dramatically without sacrificing any original image quality.
The AI is one of the most popular image file types for companies to use due to its ability to construct quality graphics for things like logos. It also allows businesses to place text on images for different projects.
How to convert PDF to AI
There are two different ways to convert a PDF to AI. The first method uses the Adobe Illustrator program. If you have the Adobe system, this method is fastest. Inside Illustrator, select the ‘file’ menu, select ‘open’, then locate the PDF file you want. From here, you’ll be able to save this PDF as an AI, finishing the conversion. Simply select the ‘file’ menu, and click ‘save’. The PDF is now an AI format file.
If you want an alternative or don’t have Adobe Illustrator installed on your current system, there are browser-based conversion tools that will do the trick. Convertio, for example, has an AI converter that lets users upload and download files in the AI format.
Why convert?
One of the strengths of the PDF is sometimes a weakness, depending on the type of project you’re creating. The PDF is perfect when you don’t want anything within a file to be altered or edited in any way. However, sometimes this is a negative.
When you need a file that you can edit extensively, you’ll have to consider converting the PDF. The AI especially has a lot of different functionality that the PDF doesn’t. This most importantly includes a variety of editing features.
If you’re working on a project that requires different files to be mass-edited, the PDF is going to cause more problems than it will help. When this is the case, the AI is a great alternative."

The PDF is a file that securely maintains print documents. Even though a PDF is capable of containing media files such as images, they’re not intended to be altered using a PDF. This is where an EPS comes in handy. Here’s a complete guide on how to convert a PDF to EPS.
What is a PDF?
The PDF document file is a Portable Document Format file type that handles print documents. It is a format which is able to contain different types of multimedia, such as audio and video files. The PDF is a secure file type that lets users view links and search within the document.
The PDF is widely-used by companies because of the way it securely contains the text and images within the document. More specifically, anytime someone shares a PDF, whether with a team member of external, it’s not likely to be edited accidentally by the recipient. Another reason it’s so popular for businesses is the PDF contains multimedia elements like audio, video or images which are shared within the document.
What is a EPS?
The EPS image file is an encapsulated postscript that gives users information about an image by offering a preview or description. It is an easy-to-alter file format that can contain both text and graphics.
A commonly used function of the EPS is the resizing that allows users to drastically alter an image. This is particularly important for this file type because the EPS are image file types typically intended to be edited through resizing in many ways after they are purchased.
How to convert PDF to EPS
There are two different ways to convert a PDF to EPS, both involve using third party software systems. When using a PDF, it’s not possible to save the file as an EPS through a file menu, therefore a converter is the only option. The first type of converter is a browser-based option. A browser-based converter is perfect for users who don’t wish to store a new program on their computer. It’s typically used when only a few files need converting. Convertio has a fast upload and download speed paired with a simple interface.
The second method to convert is by using a software system stored on a PC. This option is valuable for users who have a large amount of files to convert all at once. It’s also ideal for when there is limited internet access. CoolUtils has a downloadable converter that works great.
Why convert?
Converting makes the most sense when you have a PDF that contains images or graphics. When this is the case, it’s possible the EPS is better suited to take these images and prepare them for editing.
While the PDF is great for maintaining document files, the multimedia inside a PDF is meant to be unaltered. The EPS, on the other hand, is designed for image manipulation. You’ll be able to craft the size of the graphics within a PDF if it’s converted into an EPS.
If you have images within a PDF file that need alteration, the PDF isn’t the right type of format. When this is the case, consider following the conversion steps listed above to get your PDF into a more editable format like the EPS."

January 10, 2020|
The PDF is a powerful multimedia document that allows for secure sharing. There are times, however, when it fails to live up to user expectations. When this is the case, it’s important to know how to convert it. Here’s a guide to show how to convert the PDF to INDD.
What is a PDF?
The PDF document file stands for Portable Document Format and is a format which deals with printed documents. Within a PDF, users can search for specific terms and view hyperlinks. PDFs house multimedia like audio and video. They’re also very secure and accessible for a lot of different systems.
What is an INDD?
The INDD extension is the standard digital file format for the Adobe InDesign software program. The InDesign file extension typically contains things such as layouts and page data. It’s often used when creating things like newspapers, flyers and other advertising layouts. INDD is perfect for all types of graphic design.
How to convert the PDF to INDD
Though it is possible to export a file from INDD in PDF format, the inverse isn’t easy. There are ways to think outside the box and bring all your elements of a PDF into an INDD. However, this is just too much work. Instead, you’ll want to use a converter of some sort to automatically change the format. Typically, there’s a few different ways to automate the conversion process. However, since this conversion is so unique, the only way to accomplish it is through a system-based converter.
System-based converters are great for users who have a lot of hard drive space and limited internet access. They allow for conversion of a lot of files all at once. There are two programs I personally believe in, starting with PDFelement. This program not only converts PDFs to INDD files, it also is capable of numerous other format conversions. The other system I suggest PDF2ID, which is exclusively for converting PDF to INDD.
Why convert a PDF to INDD?
The elements of a PDF are very hard to edit, making them sort of locked into place the way they were intended. Unfortunately, this isn’t always a good thing for all parties involved. Sometimes users have specific intentions with a PDF they need to actualize. Whether it’s share it with someone for the purpose of editing or edit it themselves extensively, sometimes the PDF does better as an INDD.
As mentioned above, sometimes a PDF needs to be edited. By converting it to a INDD, users are able to use the elements within the PDF inside the Adobe InDesign program. This allows for plenty of in-depth editing. In fact, it’s overall pretty tough to edit a PDF in any manner without first converting it to a different file type.
The PDF ultimately is sometimes too secure for its own good. It prevents users from editing it extensively or accessing it easily. When this limits your work, make sure you know how to convert it."

October 16, 2019|
The NEF is the extension for images taken using a Nikon camera. Due to the raw, high quality resolution of the NEF, users sometimes wonder if it’s possible to convert other file types into a NEF to reap these benefits. Is this operation of converting a PDF to NEF achievable? Here’s a complete breakdown.
What is a PDF?
The PDF document file is a Portable Document Format file that manages printed documents. It has extensive user features including searching and viewing links. The PDF is capable of holding multimedia such as audio and video. It is a secure file type professionals use to share business documents.
What is an NEF?
The NEF image file is the Nikon Electronic Format file extension for any images that are taken using a Nikon camera. The NEF is a raw, high resolution image file that has the exact amount of quality as the photograph snapped – nothing is lost from camera to NEF. It is hard to edit, so users convert it to a different file type often.
How to convert PDF to NEF
Unfortunately, it’s not possible to convert a PDF to NEF. The NEF exists exclusively as the file extension for photographs taken by a Nikon camera. Anytime a Nikon camera’s contents are moved onto a computer, the images contained are automatically stored as NEF files. The NEF is intended to be converted into different image file types for editing.
The NEF is like a baby bird hatched from an egg. Once the egg breaks, the bird is free and lives outside the shell the rest of its life. The natural process, therefore, is egg>bird. There is no possible way to take a bird and make it into an egg. Similarly, taking other image types and trying to convert them to NEF is like taking an animal and trying to fit it into a broken egg shell.
How to convert a NEF to PDF
Even though you cannot convert the PDF into a NEF, the inverse is possible. The reason a user would want their NEF to be a PDF is to share it without the possibility of the recipients accidentally editing it. There are a couple different ways to convert a NEF to a PDF. The first is by using a desktop system. Desktop converters are great for converting a lot of files at once. CoolUtils has an effective desktop converter product.
The other way to convert is by using an online browser-based system. Browser-based programs are perfect for users who don’t want to take up hard drive space on their system. They’re also convenient when only a couple of files need to be converted. Convertio has a simple interface and fast upload speeds.
It’s impossible to convert a PDF into a NEF. Fortunately, you don’t need to. The PDF has benefits separate from the NEF for users of all necessities."

April 1, 2020|
The PDF is one of the most popular document file formats available today. Users are able to handle a lot of different tasks with a PDF. One that is mostly absent from the PDF is extensive image and graphic tasks. Since this is the case, one might get the idea of converting the PDF to a more graphic heavy-duty format. Is it possible to convert the PDF to an ORF? We will explain this and more. First, let’s make sure you have a firm grasp of what the PDF and ORF both do.
What is a PDF?
The PDF document file is a widely-used, efficient document format that is considered easy for all levels of digital expertise to use. It is a staple in professional settings, typically used for things like resumes and cover letters extensively. PDF stands for Portable Document Format. It handles printed documents and can hold media like audio and video. It is one of the safest file types available.
What is an ORF?
The ORF image file is the standard digital file format for the Olympus camera. Essentially, anytime a picture is taken using an Olympus, the file resulting from uploading that picture to a computer is in the format of the ORF. These files are extremely high resolution, replicating the exact image that was taken by the photographer. This makes them very large in size and highly inaccessible to users who don’t have access to the Olympus Viewer program.
Now that you have a base understanding of both the PDF and ORF, let’s go over the conversion process.
How to convert the PDF to ORF
Unfortunately, the PDF doesn’t convert to an ORF. It does, however, convert into a lot of different file types, including image formats. If you were hoping to convert a PDF into an ORF because of something you read about ORF files being very high quality, there are a few different file extensions capable of delivering similar results. If it was a necessity to have your files in the ORF format, this won’t be possible if they’re currently PDFs.
The ORF is a direct result of pictures taken on an Olympus camera. Their sole purpose is to act as a digital representation of an image. Think of the ORF like a dog. Once the animal is fully-grown, you wouldn’t expect it to become a puppy again. The PDF is a fully-grown dog, in this scenario – it’s not going to convert back into a puppy. However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t some alternative options. Look for other image formats that suit your needs and consider converting your PDF into them. Let’s also look at converting the ORF into a PDF, in case that comes up at some point.
Is the inverse conversion possible?
The inverse conversion, ORF to PDF, is in fact a possibility. There are in fact two different methods in which to do so. Unfortunately, neither of these methods involve the exporting function within the Olympus Viewer tool. Users wishing to convert will be limited to third party software systems. The first is through a browser-based system. This process is ideal for users without a large amount of hard drive space. It’s also better for anyone looking to convert a limited number of files. Most importantly, it is best if you have a fast internet connection if for the browser-based conversion. I recommend using Convertio when converting the ORF to PDF, as it quickly pushes through your file and prepares a fast download in return. It’s also easy for beginners to use.
The second way to convert the ORF to PDF is by using a batch converter, one that installs directly to your machine. This lets users make conversions without needing an internet connection (after the initial download and installation, of course). It’s ideal for anyone with large amounts of hard drive space and a lot of files to convert all in one session. I recommend the PearlMountain Image Converter when in need of this type of conversion.
The PDF can do a lot of great things. Converting to an ORF isn’t one of them. As you now know, the conversion wouldn’t make sense. The further your understanding of different file formats, the easier it is to recognize compatibility. Get to know the different file types to save yourself future hassles."

February 21, 2020|
The PDF gives users a chance to share professional documents that contain all sorts of media. Often times multimedia, such as images, within a PDF is needed for other purposes. When this is the case, it’s time to convert the PDF to a PNG. Here’s a complete breakdown to work you through this process. First, here’s a quick rundown of both the PDF and PNG file types.
What is a PDF document file?
A PDF document file is a file type that handles printed documents. PDF stands for Portable Document Format and allows users to search and view links within numerous pages. PDFs contain multimedia like audio and video. They’re a highly secure file type that are accessible on numerous different systems. The PDF is often used in professional settings, due to the fact it is hard to mishandle or accidentally edit.
What is a PNG image file?
The PNG image file is a lossless compression file that is quite accessible and fairly mainstream. PNG stands for Portable Network Graphics and it serves users who need high resolution image formats for editing and sharing. PNG is a raster image, meaning it constructs images based on divided sections of images. These different sections are assigned with different colors which help makeup the total image as a whole.
How do you convert the PDF to PNG?
Fortunately, there are numerous ways to make this conversion effectively. Follow whichever method you feel best suits your needs. I’ll give explanations why each would benefit you to help you decide. The first way to convert is through an automated system on a browser (web-based conversion tools). This method is convenient for users who have fast internet access and limited hard drive space. Though there are numerous options for browser-based converters, I recommend using PDFtoPNG. It’s simply the most efficient system available in this format and provides lightning-fast download speeds.
The next method is exclusively for users who have access to Adobe Acrobat. For this method, simply load your PDF file into Reader. Under ‘File’, click ‘Save as’. Next, simply choose ‘PNG’ from the file type menu, name the new file and choose its location. You now have a PNG file on your system that was previously a PDF.
Finally, Mac users have a built-in option thanks to Preview. First, open your PDF in Preview. Select ‘Export’ from the file menu. Once again, select ‘PNG’ as the type of file you wish to save it as. This is a simple method and one I highly recommend, as it lets users make this conversion without third-party software tools. If you use Windows, there’s unfortunately no similar alternative, so you’ll have to adhere to one of the two methods listed above.
Why make this conversion?
The PDF is very different from the PNG. In fact, they’re not even the same file type (PDF is a document, PNG is an image). However, sometimes a PDF will have media within itself that you’ll want to use outside the document format. For example, if a PDF has an image file on one of its pages, you can convert to a PNG to use this image file extensively.
PNG files are also lossless files, which means that when they’re compressed into a smaller size, they retain all of their resolution. If the time comes when an image needs to be used in ways further than what the PDF is capable of, the PNG offers all the necessary potential for editing and sharing at a high quality.
The PDF isn’t exactly the most interchangeable extension for PNG files and vice versa but there’s going to come a time when you need to swap one for the other. Make sure you have the steps down so that you can succeed with whatever project you’re working on."

April 17, 2020|
If you’ve used PDF extensively, you know how difficult it can be to edit and change it. Luckily, there are different files types available that can help smooth the process. Consider converting to one of them when you need different functionality. One such possible file type is the TIFF. Here’s a guide on how to convert a PDF to a TIFF. First, we’ll give a brief explanation of both formats.
What is a PDF?
The PDF document file (Portable Document Format) is a popular file type that contains things like text, images, videos and hyperlinks. It is typically the standard format for the sharing of different professional documents. This is because it restricts editing, cutting down on accidents and changes to the document. It’s also a highly secure format, capable of numerous helpful restrictions and controls.
What is a TIFF?
The TIFF image file (Tagged Image File Format) is an Adobe file type that contains high quality images. It’s a raster image that allows for both lossy and lossless compression (meaning it can lose image quality or retain it upon compression). Users who want numerous pages or layers within their project would want to use TIFF. Though TIFF is fairly accessible, it’s a pretty niche format, likely to only be used by a specific group of graphic designers.
How to convert a PDF to a TIFF
There are a few different ways to convert the PDF to TIFF. First, you could download a third party program and install it onto your system. This is only necessary if you don’t have Acrobat installed. This method is best for users with a lot of PDF files they want to convert in bulk. The other method is to use an online converter, such as a browser-based system. If you do have Adobe Acrobat, it’s preferable as it is the most direct method.
Here’s how to convert directly in Acrobat:
- Click File
- Select ‘Save as other’
- Choose ‘image’
- Select TIFF
Why convert a PDF to TIFF?
If your project is heavily image-based and you want to manipulate the images, a TIFF is probably best. The PDF is very tough to edit or change without first switching to another format. Therefore, even if you want to ultimately end up in the PDF format, it makes sense to convert, make changes, then convert back. The PDF is more likely the file type you want at the end of your process, when it’s time to send out and share the content.
The problem sometimes with the PDF is it’s just to hard to edit, especially for users without Adobe systems. One example that demonstrates this is if you were to share a PDF with another team member for a project, and they didn’t have any way to make edits to the work. This is where it ultimately makes a lot of sense to switch over to a more accessible file type like the TIFF.
How to convert back
If you decide you want the TIFF file back into a PDF format, you’ll need to perform a reverse conversion. Fortunately, converting back is done within Adobe Acrobat. We’ll walk you through the process – it’s quite easy.
- In Acrobat, click ‘File’
- Click ‘Create PDF from File’
- Click ‘Select Files to Convert to PDF’
- Locate the TIFF file you wish to convert back
There are a lot of factors that go into converting a PDF to TIFF. Make sure you have a good idea of why you’re converting before you do so. Also, remember that it’s always possible to convert back."

May 6, 2020|
A PNG is typically not meant to be the final state of an image file. Instead, you’ll need to convert it to a more manageable file type. One such type is the Adobe Illustrator file extension, AI. Here’s an explanation of how and why to do it, as well as a quick breakdown of both these popular image formats.
What is the PNG image file?
The PNG image file is one of the more popular graphic formats available, especially because of how high resolution its photos are. The PNG (Portable Network Graphic) is a lossless compression file type, which means it doesn’t lose quality when a user reduces its size. It uses raster graphics, so it is essentially structured by digital pixels to form an image.
What is the AI image file?
The AI image file is the graphic extension used for Adobe Illustrator image projects. Companies commonly use the AI because of how well it manages different brand logos and designs. The AI allows users to place text onto their graphics. It’s very high in resolution, though it’s limited because of how inaccessible it is. It is a vector graphic type, which means it is constructed through different digital indicators.
Why convert PNG to AI?
A PNG is meant to be a high quality file that loses resolution only when it’s time to edit it. Unfortunately, in order to edit it extensively, it needs to be converted into a more manageable file type. There are a lot of extensions that allow for further editing but Illustrator is a lot more complex. Another reason users might require an AI instead of a PNG is if they need to share the file with others. Even though many will have access to the PNG, it is possible that they prefer an AI.
How to convert PNG to AI
If you have Adobe Illustrator, you can easily convert a PNG to more functioning AI image file types. If you don’t, you’ll have to use one of the many conversion programs listed below. Here’s how to convert inside Illustrator:
- Using Illustrator, open the PNG file you wish to convert
- Select ‘Object’ then ‘Image Trace’ then ‘Make’
- Your PNG will now be editable within Illustrator and can be saved as AI
Note that you can use the available tools in Illustrator to change which portions of the PNG you wish to edit.
Conversion programs
If you don’t have Adobe Illustrator, you’ll need to convert in one of two ways. The first way is by using an online, browser-based converter. There are a number of them available, though I prefer Convertio the best due to its fast speeds and simplistic interface. A huge benefit of using an online converter is you don’t have to install any software on your system. Simply upload your file then download the converted file.
The second method of conversion is downloading and installing a system to convert. This option favors users who need a lot of different files converted at once. It’s also great for those with slow or limited internet access. This is because you can convert without uploading or downloading any files. Vector Magic has a desktop edition that works very well, though there are other systems to consider.
How to convert back
Fortunately, a lot of the same programs that convert a PNG to AI work the opposite way too. For example, Convertio converts AI to PNG. If you make a mistake and delete the original PNG file, just upload the AI file into Convertio and download a new PNG. It’s pretty rare that you’ll need to make a reverse conversion, but keep it in mind just in case.
Survey all your options when deciding how and why to convert a PNG to AI. There’s a lot of different ways to do it and they each function much differently from one another. Pick the one that works best for you."

October 2, 2019|
The CR2 is a high quality raw image taken from a Canon camera. If you’ve ever thought about whether it’s possible to convert a PNG to a CR2, this article is for you. Here’s a breakdown of both of the image file types.
What’s a PNG?
The PNG image file is a Portable Network Graphic that is high in quality and resolution. It’s a raster image, meaning its graphics are constructed piece-by-piece using a grid of pixels. PNG uses lossless compression, which ensures it doesn’t lose quality when shrinking in size.
What’s a CR2?
The CR2 image file is the file type that all photographs taken with a Canon camera are stored on. CR2 is the Canon Raw 2, meaning second edition. It’s a high resolution file capable of displaying the most detailed, intimate pieces of an image.
How to convert a PNG to a CR2
There is no way to convert a PNG into a CR2 image. The CR2 is the resulting file type of a photograph taken by a Canon camera. If a Canon camera downloads its files into a digital format, they’re automatically stored as a CR2. This format is meant to be converted into other image file types of size requirements and editing – not the other way around.
The CR2 is similar to a group of ingredients used for cooking. In their initial phase, they’re all individual of each other (flour, sugar, etc.). However, as they get mixed together, they become part of a finished meal. It wouldn’t make sense to try to convert the finished product back into single ingredients. Similarly, it doesn’t work to convert a PNG to a CR2.
How to convert a CR2 to PNG
There is, however, plenty of ways to convert a CR2 to a PNG. The first and most convenient method is using an online converter program. These systems are browser-based and don’t take up hard drive space (other than the PNG file you download afterward). I prefer Convertio for its simplicity and fast upload/download speeds.
The other method is a desktop system. This is ideal for users who have numerous CR2 files to convert. It’s also preferred for people with limited internet access. Most importantly, it’s safer for people with sensitive images they need to convert. I like CoolUtils’ Total Image Converter system.
It’s not possible to convert a PNG to a CR2. However, a PNG is already in its ideal format to be edited and manipulated. Look for the right tools to help you do so."

September 30, 2019|
The PNG is one of many image file types that has limitations sometimes unacceptable for users. Because of this, it’s important to be able to know how and why to convert one. Here’s a guide explaining how to convert a PNG to EPS.
What is a PNG?
The PNG image file is a raster image lossless compression file type. Raster images are built using a grid of pixels and are perfect for things like photographs. Lossless compression is when an image type can change into a smaller size without losing image quality.
What is an EPS?
The EPS image file is an encapsulated postscript image file that provides previews and descriptions of images. It is highly customizable, capable of being edited and resized in different ways. It also contains both graphics and text. It is typically used within the Adobe Reader system.
How to convert PNG to EPS
Converting a PNG to an EPS is really going to come down to your personal preference. If you have a lot of files you need to convert, downloading and installing a converter might be the best bet. If you don’t have a lot of hard drive space or don’t want to commit to an installation, browser-based systems are for you.
Once you’ve figured out which type of converter you want to use, determine next which system fits best. Sometimes all this takes is trying a few different converters to see which one gives you the best features and results. For systems that require installation, VectorMagic has an easy-to-use interface and a lot of nice features. For browser-based systems, Convertio is a simple site with fast uploads and downloads.
Why convert?
The PNG is a high quality image that retains resolution when it shrinks. However, it’s not a good fit for a lot of important image functions. The EPS, on the other hand, is very versatile and customizable. Converting to an EPS gives more freedom to edit with a variety of tools.
For example, a company creating a logo would most likely want a PNG file to be converted into an EPS. This is because the EPS is optimal for printing illustrations. Furthermore, printing a logo from an EPS file allows for higher quality.
The PNG has a lot of important benefits for different tasks. However, there are going to be times when an EPS is better. Make sure you have an easy way to convert for when that time comes."

September 26, 2019|
Is it possible to convert a PNG to an INDD? Not exactly, but there are some sneaky ways to get the job done. Here’s an explanation of the two file types as well as a guide to convert them.
What is a PNG?
A PNG stands for Portable Network Graphic and is a file type that has lossless compression. This means it keeps the original quality of an image even when it’s shrunk in size. A PNG image file uses raster graphics as it is made up of a grid of pixels.
What is an INDD?
The INDD is the Adobe InDesign file extension. It’s designed to manage things such as newsletters and books. INDD is capable of keeping all the different parts of a project together as they were originally intended. It is a large file type.
How to convert a PNG to an INDD
The PNG and INDD aren’t exactly compatible. Unlike other image file types, the INDD has different characteristics than the PNG. It’s a completely different type of file used for other things. However, it is possible to bring a PNG file into the InDesign system.
In order to move a PNG to the InDesign system, you’re going to need to use the ‘place’ feature. First, open the InDesign software. Select ‘file’ then ‘place’ and choose the PNG graphic you want to use. You’ll now have a workable, editable version of the PNG inside an INDD.
How to convert an INDD to PNG
If you’re looking for a program to convert an INDD to PNG, you won’t find one. That’s because just like with the inverse conversion, the INDD isn’t compatible with PNG in a way that allows conversion. Instead, it takes some maneuvering to turn an INDD into a PNG.
First, export your INDD file as an EPS. In InDesign, choose ‘file’ then ‘export’ and save the file as an EPS. Next, open the newly-created EPS file using Adobe Illustrator. Once inside Illustrator, save the file as a PNG. There probably won’t ever be a program dedicated to converting INDD to PNG, so take these extra steps when necessary.
When it comes to image files, there’s often confusion about which extensions are interchangeable with one another. Though PNG is convertible into a lot of different file types, INDD isn’t one of them. Fortunately, you can get creative to create a usable PNG in InDesign."

October 12, 2019|
The PNG is a high quality image file with a lot of functionality. However, when it comes to sharing images, building websites or downloading multiple files, the PNG is lacking. Fortunately the JPG is strong in these areas. Learn how to convert the PNG to JPG.
What is a PNG?
The PNG image file is a Portable Network Graphic file which is a raster image. A raster file builds graphics piece-by-piece. The PNG uses lossless compression, which lets large files shrink into smaller sizes without losing resolution. If a PNG is reverted to its original size the resolution remains the same.
What is a JPG?
The JPG image file is a widely-used file type because of its unusual small size. The JPG compression makes it a manageable size which also lowers the quality of images. It’s usually used when someone needs to upload or download a large quantity of images.
How to convert PNG to JPG using Windows
- Open the selected PNG file in the Microsoft Paint program
- Select ‘File’, click ‘Save as’
- Type the desired file name in the ‘File name’ space
- Click the ‘Save as type’ dropdown menu and select ‘JPEG’
- Click ‘Save’ and the file will be saved into the selected destination
How to convert PNG to JPG using Mac
- Find the PNG file you wish to convert
- Using ‘Preview’, click ‘File’ then choose ‘Export’
- Choose JPG from the list
- Click ‘Save’
There are multiple ways to convert a PNG to JPG, though the easiest way for Windows and Mac users is to use the operations shown above. Other options are to use a conversion program. There are numerous free programs on the web to choose from. It all depends on whether you want to use a browser-based system or an installed program.
Why convert PNG to JPG?
Consider converting your image file from PNG to JPG if you need a smaller file size. There are many reasons you might need an image file to be shrunken down. PNG is in a class of high quality image file types that retain all information and quality. However, Especially for businesses, JPG is superior because it plays a role in building websites.
When a company builds its webpage, it knows the importance of keeping customers on the page. If a page takes too long to load, the customer leaves. This is why organizations convert PNG files to JPG. It creates a more compact image for websites, letting older computers and slower internet users view the site as well as others with superior connections.
Further issues to consider
One thing to note is the reverse conversion (JPG to PNG) can be done if necessary. The process at the beginning of the article works in the other direction as well. Follow the steps but convert back to the PNG instead.
Another thing to point out is to be careful with this conversion if image quality is paramount to your business. Photographers with high quality photos are likely not going to want to compress an image into a smaller, less quality file. Make sure the source is known and is accepting to the idea of the conversion.
If you’re creating a website or uploading a lot of separate files, the PNG might give you some issues. Consider taking the above steps to convert to a JPG to solve these problems."
207,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-png-to-nef/,"Can you convert a PNG file to NEF?
April 29, 2020|
A lot of inexperienced users read about the NEF image file format and wonder if they can convert other image types into it. This is understandable, as a NEF is a raw image file with high quality. However, the process is complicated, depending on the file type you use. Here’s a breakdown to help everyone understand it better.
What’s a PNG image file?
The PNG image file is a very popular graphic format, mostly due to its high resolution and accessibility. A PNG is a Portable Network Graphic that uses lossless compression – meaning it retains all of its quality and resolution when it shrinks in size. It is an image file that uses raster graphics, which means it’s mapped by a structural grid of pixels. Finally, the PNG can be opened by a wide range of different programs, making it easy to share as well.
What’s an NEF image file?
The NEF image file is a Nikon Electronic Format graphic that is the result of any photograph snapped using a Nikon camera. It is a raw image that, like PNG, is lossless compression. The NEF is typically not the end result as most users convert them to a different file type. The official Nikon software that handles the NEF is the Capture NX-D, which provides some essentially editing options to photographers.
How to convert a PNG to a NEF
Unfortunately, there’s no way to convert a PNG to a NEF. This is because the NEF is a direct result of a photograph taken on a Nikon camera. Whenever a photographer uses a Nikon camera and uploads their files digitally, they’re stored in the NEF format. From there, they edit and convert them to more accessible image file types. This is the only way to create an NEF, but don’t worry, you don’t need to convert the PNG to NEF anyhow. Everything you need in terms of editing and sharing is already available with a PNG.
Think of the NEF like a vintage painting. You can convert it to things like printed pictures, digital pictures and other image media. However, you can’t convert a digital photo into a vintage painting, being that the artist is deceased among other reasons. The same goes with the NEF – it is the painting. It can be converted into other images, but not vice-versa.
How to convert a NEF to a PNG
Even though you can’t convert the PNG to NEF, the reverse conversion does in fact work. There are a couple different ways to convert a NEF to a PNG. First, you can open the NEF file using a graphic editing program and then save it as a different type of file. For example, you could open a NEF in Adobe Photoshop, then save it as a PNG. Note that the flagship software, Capture NX-D, doesn’t allow for saving into the PNG format.
The other method is through an online converter. There are quite a few programs that convert NEF to PNG. One that works well for me is Convert.Files. This is a browser-based system, meaning you don’t need to install it. It’s only recommended that you have a sufficiently fast internet connection and enough hard drive space. Give it a shot if you don’t want to install software in order to convert.
Remember, if you’re trying to convert a PNG to a NEF, you need to find a different file format. There are plenty of other image types available, so look around until you find the one that works best for you."

September 22, 2019|
Is it possible to convert a PNG to ORF? Would there be a good reason to do so? These questions are answered and more in this breakdown of the different file types.
What’s a PNG?
A PNG is a Portable Network Graphic that uses lossless compression. It retains its highest quality and resolution when it shrinks in size. A PNG is an image file that uses raster graphics, which means it’s constructed by a grid of pixels.
What’s an ORF?
An ORF is the Olympus Raw Format image file type which is the standard storage type for any photograph taken with an Olympus camera. It is an extremely high resolution file type, containing greater bits per pixel than other formats.
How to convert a PNG to an ORF
The ORF is the initial, raw format of an image. In order to produce an ORF, you need to take a picture using an Olympus camera and upload it to the computer. Therefore, it’s not possible to convert a PNG to an ORF. In fact, there’s no reason to either. Typically, an ORF is converted into more manageable image file types.
An ORF is like a large block of marble in the shape of a rectangle. It needs to be converted into a recognizable statue through careful sculpting. You wouldn’t take a sculpted statue and try to convert it into a rectangular block of marble. Similarly, you wouldn’t take an editable image file and convert it into an ORF.
How to convert an ORF to a PNG
It’s not possible to convert a PNG to an ORF, but it is possible to convert an ORF to a PNG. In fact, there are different methods available to do so. The first way is likely the most popular and it’s using the Olympus Viewer. Viewer supports conversion into the JPEG, which can then be converted easily to a PNG using a program like MS Paint.
The other way to convert a PNG to an ORF is a third party software program, such as CloudConvert. CloudConvert is a browser-based system that doesn’t require installation in order to convert. All that is needed is an upload of the ORF file and then a download of the new PNG file.
There’s no real way to convert a PNG to an ORF. Look for alternative file types to convert your PNG to. Use all the tools your operating system and browser-based systems provide to land on the right image file for you."

November 23, 2019|
PNG images provide high quality resolution photos with editing functionality. However, there are a few downsides that need to be considered. When the negatives are overwhelming or you need your image in a different, consider the PDF. Here’s a quick rundown of both file types, followed by a simple guide on how to convert a PNG to PDF.
What is a PNG?
The PNG image file is a Portable Networks Graphics File. It’s a raster image, meaning it builds a graphic based on small identifiers assigned to different sections of a picture. It’s a very large file size that uses lossless compression, which allows users to reduce its size without losing quality of the original image.
What is a PDF?
The PDF document file is a Portable Document Format file that is very efficient and simple to use. It handles print documents and allows users to search and view links within a document. The PDF holds multimedia files such as audio and video. It’s often used by professionals, as it’s safe to open a PDF using different systems.
How to convert a PNG to a PDF using Windows
Note that there are alternative routes to converting, including downloading and installing third party software. However, here are the most common ways using the most popular operating systems. Converting a PNG to a PDF file takes a few steps and maneuvers, so I’ve broken it down into the easiest possible route:
- Locate the PNG file you wish to convert
- Right click it and select ‘open with’
- Select the Photos option (icon image pictured below)
- Inside the Microsoft Photos software, click the printer icon
- There will be a dropdown selection for printer, which should be displaying your home printer. Click it and change it to Microsoft print to PDF
- Select print
- Name the file and save it in the location of your choice
How to convert a PNG to a PDF using Mac
Converting a PNG to a PDF on the Mac is a little simpler and comes with fewer steps. Here’s the easiest route:
- Open ‘Preview’
- Find the desired PNG image
- Once opened, click ‘File’
- Click ‘Print’
- Choose ‘save as PDF’
- Name the file and choose a location
When should you consider converting from PNG to PDF?
A PNG is a great file type for images of high resolution. However, it lacks some features that will prompt a conversion to PDF. Here are the two major reasons. First, accessibility is an issue with PNG. So many users are incapable of accessing PNG files, making it obsolete in a lot of ways. PDF, on the other hand, is accessible to most users on different devices.
The next issue is security and PNG is lacking in it. An original PNG file can be manipulated and exploited from every user with access to it. It’s incapable of being locked or secured and has too many editing capabilities. Alternatively, a PDF is lockable using passwords. This is a big issue that a lot of large companies take into consideration.
Further concerns to review
If you didn’t save the original PNG copy, you can convert a PDF back to a PNG as well. There are a lot of third-party programs that are capable of doing a quick conversion. Unfortunately, there’s no way to convert from a PDF to a PNG using the Windows or Mac operating system, so downloading new software is the only option. The easiest and most effective tool I’ve found to convert a PDF to a PNG is the PDF to Image tool.
Switching an image from PNG to PDF has its benefits but it also loses some during the conversion. The editing functions of PNG are limited once the file is in PDF, which is great for security but bad for revision. Make sure you implement your conversion at the ideal times."

October 7, 2019|
Sometimes the best way to change, edit or manipulate an image is to change its extension. In the case of PNG, a lot of times the editing process is best actualized when it’s transformed entirely. See why converting the PNG to PSD has immense value and learn how to do it.
What is a PNG?
The PNG image file or Portable Network Graphic is a file with lossless compression that maintains high quality graphics even when the file size is shrunk. PNG uses raster graphics that construct images using a pixel grid, which is why the PNG is high resolution.
What is a PSD?
The PSD image file is a Photoshop document that is a resulting file of Adobe Photoshop. It is a file that uses multiple layers of images that can be re-edited when opened. The PSD is typically used for high quality graphics.
How to convert PNG to PSD
Because of the layers of PSD, it’s impractical to open a PNG inside Photoshop. The image wouldn’t show up correctly, thus making it impossible to manually convert a PNG to a PSD from inside the Photoshop program. However, there are alternative options.
In order to convert a PNG to a PSD, you’ll have to use a browser-based converter system. There are a plethora of possible options but the one I feel has the best features is Convertio. It has a very fast upload and download time, with a 100MB maximum file size. It’s also a simple-to-use system with a smooth interface.
Why convert?
The PNG cannot store multiple images in one file, whereas the PSD allows layered images. This allows for editing of multiple images in a single file. Also, for experienced Photoshop users, a good understanding of the different editing tools make working with a PSD image much easier. The PNG is similar to a lot of image file types in that it needs to be edited in order to be part of publications. This is because things like websites run slowly if bogged down by large image sizes.
When deciding whether to convert, evaluate different factors such as who’s going to use the file, what are their needs and what are their preferred software tools. These factors are the most important thing, as the image file only is convenient to someone if they’re able to use it. For example, if you send an image file to a client who uses strictly Photoshop, the process will run smoothly if the file is in PSD format.
Whether you’re catering to another user’s preference or bolstering editing capabilities, a PSD often makes the most sense to use. When a PNG falls short, consider the Photoshop-based alternative."
211,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-png-to-tiff/,"How to convert a PNG image file to a TIFF
October 30, 2019|
The PNG is a very basic image file with quality resolution. The TIFF, on the other hand, has a lot of complexities that other image file types don’t. Use this guide to learn how to convert a PNG to a TIFF.
What is a PNG?
The PNG image file is a raster image, meaning it is constructed piece-by-piece using different sections. It’s a lossless compression file type, which entails it’s capable of transforming into a much smaller size without losing any of the original resolution or quality.
What is a TIFF?
The TIFF image file is a Tagged Image File Format that is extremely secure. In fact, it’s one of the most safe image types available. It also stores metadata within each file, giving users important information about the image without having to open a file.
How to convert using Windows
It’s simple to convert a PNG file to a TIFF file using Windows, especially if you just need one file converted. Here’s how to do it:
- Locate the PNG file you wish to convert
- Right-click it
- Select ‘edit’ (or select ‘open with’ then select ‘paint’)
- In the opened paint image, select ‘file’ then ‘save as’
- In the dropdown box under the naming space, select TIFF
- Click ‘save’ and your TIFF file is ready
How to convert using Mac
- Locate the PNG file you wish to convert
- Using ‘Preview’, click ‘File’ then choose ‘Export’
- Choose TIFF from the list
- Click ‘Save’
- Your TIFF file is ready
Remember that these are the most basic ways to convert. If you don’t want to go through these steps each time, a third-party conversion software is the way to go. Furthermore, conversion software might work better for files in bulk.
Why convert?
The PNG is a very basic image file type and cannot handle a lot of the things a TIFF can. TIFF is known to efficiently hold large volumes of graphic data. It is also space-saving due to its compression capabilities, in which it shrinks in size while not sacrificing a lot of quality. Also, the extensive metadata of TIFF make it ideal for users who need a lot of information about their files at any given time.
The TIFF is known for its multi-page functionality, something the PNG isn’t capable of. Multiple-paged images should be printed and saved in a TIFF. If you have a project in need of a large amount of printed pages, converting from PNG to TIFF makes a lot of sense.
How to convert back
It’s certainly possible to convert back in case you lose the original PNG file. In order to do so, either use a converter and set it to PNG or use a similar method to the ones above. Here’s a quick outline to convert backward.
Windows
- Locate the TIFF file
- Right-click it
- Select ‘edit’ (or select ‘open with’ then select ‘paint’)
- In the opened paint image, select ‘file’ then ‘save as’
- In the dropdown box under the naming space, select PNG
- Click ‘save’ and your PNG file is ready
Mac
- Locate the TIFF file
- Using ‘Preview’, click ‘File’ then choose ‘Export’
- Choose PNG from the list
- Click ‘Save’
- Your PNG file is ready
This would only be necessary in the result of an accidental deletion of your original PNG file. TIFF files typically don’t fit well into a PNG, so avoid this conversion if possible.
The PNG gives users a foundation for editing and image sharing. However, it lacks the complexity TIFF offers. If you need a complicated solution, convert to the TIFF."
212,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-psd-to-ai/,"A guide to convert the PSD image file to the AI
November 13, 2019|
The PSD has loads of editing potential but it doesn’t always fit the needs of a company. When your business needs to create a project using unique tools, the AI might be the superior format. If this is the case, it’s important to learn how to switch the formats. Use this guide to convert a PSD to AI.
What is a PSD image file?
The PSD image file is the file extension from the Adobe Photoshop program. The PSD is unusual in a sense, as it contains different facets of the same image. It also holds multiple different images. It is ultimately a highly editable image because the program Photoshop was created to extensively change images.
What is an AI image file?
The AI image file is the file extension from the Adobe Illustrator program. The AI is highly scalable and uses a unique graphic type, the vector. Vector graphics are built using different points, which help determine numerous different image factors. Finally, users are able to resize AI files while maintaining their resolution.
How to convert
There are a few different ways to convert the PSD to AI – we’ll begin with the most direct route. If you have Adobe Illustrator on your computer, you’ll be able to convert it manually. First, open Illustrator. Make sure you create a new document by navigating to the ‘file’ menu and clicking ‘new’. From there, once again use the ‘file’ menu but this time select ‘open’. A window will pop up, allowing you to select the PSD file from your system. Once it’s open, simply save the current document as an AI file.
If you don’t have Adobe Illustrator on your system or want an alternative conversion method, you can try a browser-based converter. If you have a strong internet connection and limited hard drive space, this is likely the best option for you. Only use the browser-based systems if you need a small number of files converted. I recommend the Convertio program for its smooth interface and fast speeds.
The final option is a downloadable program that installs onto your computer. This is a convenient choice for users who have limited internet access, as it can be used without internet access. Furthermore, this choice gives users the chance to convert files in bulk. If this seems like it would be of benefit to you, check out reaConverter. It’s a powerful, downloadable conversion program.
Why convert?
The PSD is highly editable and is capable of being molded into a lot of different convenient graphic purposes. However, there are some times when users need different things out of their image file types. Converting it into an AI file usually depends on if the graphic will be used in a business setting. When the editing and final result are enterprise-based, a switch to AI makes a lot of sense.
The AI file is very specific to business graphics. Even though the PSD can manipulate graphics in a lot of different ways, it lacks the niche editing the AI can handle. For example, the AI stands out when it comes to brand logos. This is because of its resizability, which becomes more valuable when logos are inevitably used in different advertisements. Finally, the AI is great at things such as text inclusion on graphics. This is something businesses often utilize.
The PSD is an amazing image file for extensive editing. However, it doesn’t work as well when it comes to creating brand images. When you’re looking to make enterprise logos and advertisements, you’ll need something advanced like the AI."

The CR2 is a high resolution image file that holds the raw, untouched picture taken from a Canon camera. Is it possible to convert a PSD into a CR2? I’ll discuss that here and give you a strong understanding of both these image formats.
What is PSD?
The PSD image file is the official file format for images produced from the Adobe Photoshop software. A PSD file is unique in that it incorporates different aspects of an image. It also contains multiple different images when needed. The PSD is mainly a file type used to edit and change graphics.
What is CR2?
The CR2 image file is the official file format for any photograph taken with a Canon camera then uploaded to a computer. The CR2 stands for Canon Raw 2 because it’s the second edition of the file type. It’s a raw image that is completely unchanged from photo to computer file. It’s also very high resolution and extremely large in size.
How to convert PSD to CR2
There’s unfortunately no way to convert a PSD to a CR2. This is because the CR2 is a raw image file from a professional camera. If you think of image file types as a process, the CR2 would be the beginning of the process. The PSD would be the end of the process. The middle stage would involve converting from the CR2, then editing and saving as a PSD. There’s simply no way, manual or otherwise, to perform this conversion.
The CR2 is an exact representation of the original photograph snapped from a Canon camera. Because it is raw and untouched, a PSD cannot convert into it. Think of a CR2 like a vinyl musical record. For this example, the PSD is a guitar. The guitar can play noises that ultimately end up on a record, but you can’t turn a guitar itself into a vinyl record. This is essentially the process of converting a PSD to a CR2.
How to convert CR2 to PSD
Even though it’s not possible to convert a PSD into a CR2, the opposite operation can be done. In fact, there are a couple ways to accomplish this. The first way is by using a browser-based conversion tool. These programs are perfect for users who only need to convert a limited number of files. They also are practical for those with not much hard drive space available. One such conversion tool Convertio, a system with a smooth interface and fast upload speeds.
The other method of conversion involves downloading and installing a program onto your computer. This is best for users who don’t always have internet access or have limited access. An installed system converts the files without requiring the internet. Also, an installed system is great for users with a large quantity of files they need converted. These types of systems let users convert files in bulk. I recommend the PearlMountain Image Converter for an installation-based system.
There’s no way to convert a PSD to a CR2 but you don’t need to anyway. The PSD is already in the format you require for things like editing and sharing."

April 7, 2020|
If you’ve tried to convert the PSD to INDD, it becomes clear very quickly that it’s a tricky maneuver that requires some creative efforts. In case you didn’t find a real solution to the problem, this guide will explain everything necessary in order to make this conversion. First, here’s a quick rundown of both of these file types to show their nuanced differences.
What is a PSD image file?
The PSD image file is the official file format for the Adobe Photoshop software program. PSD stands for PhotoShop Document. It is a unique type of image file format, containing many different image aspects (also contains numerous different images). PSD files are intended to be extensively edited and manipulated. Unlike other image formats, the PSD is set up to work within a single program, limiting its accessibility to a specific set of users.
What is the INDD file type?
The INDD is the official InDesign file extension, exclusive to Adobe’s InDesign software system. It’s commonly used in professional digital prints like newsletters, flyers and similar publications. The most common elements within INDD files are layouts, page data and different files. The INDD is usually reserved for publishing things like newspapers and other printed material. It is able to maintain the visual layout for an entire project no matter if anything is altered within it.
How to convert the PSD to INDD
There’s unfortunately no direct way to convert a PSD to INDD. If you’re looking for some type of tool that automates the process, it does not exist. There’s also not any sort of way to simply export or save a PSD file as an INDD. That’s not to say, however, that there isn’t any type of work-around. In fact, you can technically make this conversion in a sense.
Here’s how to turn your PSD file into an INDD manually. You will need to have access to Adobe InDesign software for this to work. First, create a new InDesign project document. Use the ‘Place’ feature (File > Place) to input your PSD file. You’ll then be able to save this image in an INDD format. Though this isn’t a direct conversion, it offers users a chance to move their PSD into the INDD extension.
Why make this conversion?
There are a couple different reasons someone might want their PSD file to be in the format of INDD. The first scenario would be in the case of some type of accessibility issue. For example, say you were working on a project and had to share a file with another team member. If they said they wanted it in INDD format so they could edit using the program of their choice, it would make sense for you to put it into this format for them.
Another reason this conversion would make sense is the differences in capabilities of these file types. The PSD is specifically suited for large editing projects, while the INDD is better for layered print projects. If you need less editing and more page-to-page input, it might make sense to switch over.
At the end of the day, there’s no clean way to convert the PSD to INDD. However, with a little creativity, there are ways to get nearly the result you require."

March 4, 2020|
The PSD is one of the best formats for editing extensively. Though this is the case, there are some aspects of the PSD that restrict users. When this becomes an issue, consider converting the PSD to a JPG. This guide will walk you through the important steps and details.
What is a PSD image file?
The PSD image file is the standard format for all Adobe Photoshop files. PSD stands for PhotoShop Document. It contains different image features, including the possibility to hold numerous images. The PSD is highly editable, as Photoshop is one of the most extensive editing programs available.
What is a JPG image file?
The JPG image file is part of the Joint Photographic Experts Group standard file format. It is often confused with JPEG, which is completely acceptable since the two file types are interchangeable. The JPG is one of the most popular file types due to its convenient size and accessibility. The JPG is a lossy compression file type, which indicates a resolution loss whenever it reduces in size.
How to convert the PSD to JPG?
There are a lot of different ways to convert the PSD to JPG, beginning with a manual conversion. This method only requires access to the Adobe Photoshop software program. To convert manually, import the PSD file you wish to change. Under ‘File’, choose ‘Save As’. In the ‘Format’ dropdown section, select ‘JPG’ (note that ‘JPEG’ might be the only option available – this is interchangeable with JPG) then click ‘Save’. You’ll have a JPG file saved on your computer.
If you don’t have access to Photoshop or would like a different way to convert, there are browser-based converters available. These are great for users who have fast internet access but limited hard drive space. You’ll want a competent internet connection as well as enough hard drive space to download a new JPG file, which should be reasonably-sized no matter what. I recommend using Zamzar for this conversion, since it is fast and easy to use.
Why should you make this conversion?
Now that you have the ‘how’ down, let’s make sure you know the ‘why’. If you love keeping your images in the PSD format, it’s likely you’re well-versed in the Photoshop program and tools. This is totally reasonable, however, not everyone is going to share this sentiment. Certainly, this becomes an issue when you share files with other users, such as clients or fellow team members of projects.
So, why does the JPG make so much sense in comparison? The answer comes down to accessibility and practicality. First, it’s a lot easier to send a smaller file to another user. This might seem negligible at first glance but sending thousands of image files at once makes this a huge issue. Also, if you share a single PSD with 50 other users and only half of them have access to Adobe products, you’ve inconvenienced them greatly. Consider the benefits of JPG when these issues arise.
Even though the PSD serves quite a strong purpose, typically to edit freely and extensively, it often fails to perform some of the basic functions users require. If sharing and space requirements become an issue, be sure you have an alternative file type in mind."
216,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-psd-to-nef/,"How do I convert my PSD image files to NEF?
February 28, 2020|
It’s inevitable when considering our different image files that we discover a file type we wish to switch them to. The NEF image file, on the surface, has a ton of benefits that sound ideal for anyone managing images. If you’re working with a PSD and feel like it would be better suited as an NEF, here’s a guide to explore this and other options.
What is the PSD image file?
The PSD image file is the standard file type for the Adobe Photoshop software system. It contains a wide variety of image aspects and numerous different images. A PSD is designed to edit graphics extensively, making it a popular choice for users with advanced editing knowledge and requirements.
What is a NEF image file?
The NEF image file is a raw representation of any photograph snapped on a Nikon camera. This means that the NEF is exactly identical to the original picture from the camera with absolutely no resolution-loss. NEF stands for Nikon Electronic Format. It is an extremely large file that is difficult to edit, so users end up converting the file quite a bit.
Is it possible to convert from PSD to NEF?
It’s obvious why a lot of users attempt to find a way to convert their image files to NEF. They briefly read about the NEF and see it’s extremely high in quality. Unfortunately, this basic understanding of the NEF leads to failed attempts at conversion. The same result is inevitable for anyone trying to convert the PSD to a NEF – it just isn’t possible. As the NEF is a digital file from a specific camera, converting a non-camera file into it isn’t logical.
Where does this leave us then? Well, if we’re working with PSD files and want something different, it’s likely we need a file that is a little more accessible and shareable. If that’s the case, we should try converting our PSD into things like PNG, JPEG or BMP. All of these retain plenty of resolution, are easy to edit and quick to share. They don’t have the resolution of the NEF but that’s a sacrifice we’ll have to make for convenience-sake.
Is the inverse conversion possible? How?
Now, let’s say we’re on the other side of this issue and we’re working with a lot of NEF files. Unlike the ORF, which has a very edit-friendly software system designation, the NEF leaves users with little editing options. For that reason it makes a lot of sense to convert the NEF into a PSD. Doing so will provide us with a more editable and accessible image file. Here’s a simple instructional to guide you through the process.
First, you’ll need to seek out a third-party conversion system, as no manual conversion method exists for this process. Fortunately, there are quite a few different browser-based converters available, all with different features and qualifications. If you’re not sure which to select, that’s fine, they’re all relatively straightforward and effective. Just to be sure though, I recommend using Convertio, a fast system with a simple interface. Keep in mind that this conversion requires a stable internet connection, so if you’re planning on being away from internet access for an extended period of time, it makes sense to complete all your conversions at one time.
The allure of the NEF is certainly its high resolution and absolutely untarnished image representation. In theory, it would make sense to convert our images to NEF to achieve these benefits. Unfortunately, it just doesn’t work that way. If you want an image file type with manageable size and high quality, you’ll have to seek out some of the more popular non-raw alternatives."
217,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-psd-to-orf/,"Is it possible to convert the PSD image file to ORF?
November 22, 2019|
The ORF is a high resolution image that secures a photographer’s original vision on a digital file. With all the conversion tools available, users often wonder if they could turn different image types into the ORF. In this article, I’ll explain if it’s even possible to convert the PSD to ORF.
What is PSD?
The PSD image file is the official file extension for documents of the Adobe Photoshop software. The PSD stands out among image file types due to the fact it maintains numerous aspects of an image and multiple different images.
What is ORF?
The ORF image file stands for Olympus Raw Image File. It’s the official file format for any photograph taken from Olympus cameras then uploaded to a computer. The ORF is an exact digital representation of the original photograph, which makes it very large in size and high in quality.
How to convert PSD to ORF
I have some bad news for anyone looking to convert the PSD to ORF – it’s impossible. The ORF is a raw image from a specific professional camera. It was designed to represent photographs from Olympus cameras digitally and nothing else. The good news here is that you don’t actually need to convert PSD files to ORF. This is because the PSD is already in the format you would require to edit and resize.
To help you further understand why it’s not possible to convert a PSD to ORF, imagine a field of sheep. Think of the sheep as ORF files. Now, think of a large pile of wool on the ground that has been sheared off the sheep. This hair represents a PSD. It would never make sense for someone to decide they want to put the hair back onto the sheep, nor would it be possible. The hair is already in its optimal format anyway, as it can be used to make clothes, etc.
How to convert ORF to PSD
In case you’re a bit disappointed, here’s something that will cheer you up: it’s easy to convert the ORF to PSD for extensive editing. In fact, there’s more than one way to convert. The first method involves using a browser-based conversion tool. This is ideal for users with limited hard drive space who only need to convert a couple files rather than a large quantity. Convertio is one of the best browser-based converters due to its fast speeds and simple interface.
The other method is a system-based converter which installs onto your computer. This is better-suited for users who have extensive hard drive space, limited or slow internet access and a large amount of files to convert. The most prevalent reason users choose to install a converter is they want to convert hundreds of files in bulk. When this sounds like it would fit your needs, check out Pearl Mountain Image Converter. It easily handles your bulk conversions.
Unfortunately, the PSD doesn’t convert into an ORF format. However, the PSD is much more editable and better for resizing. Also, the ORF does in fact convert into the PSD. Keep that in mind when looking into working with a lot of photographer collections."
218,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-psd-to-pdf/,"A guide to convert the PSD image file to a PDF
January 6, 2020|
The PSD is a highly editable image file that allows users to work with different graphics and designs within it. However, sometimes users need a file that simply exists for others to see and not be edited. Whether it’s for sharing with a coworker, a friend or a corporation, sometimes you need to convert the PSD to a PDF. Here’s a guide to help you out.
What is the PSD?
The PSD image file is the official file format for the Adobe Photoshop program. PSD stands for Photoshop document and is drastically different from most image files. This is because it typically contains numerous images and can reflect multiple aspects of graphics. It’s an efficient file for editing graphics extensively.
What is the PDF?
The PDF document file is a format that contains printed documents. It allows users to search and view links within a document. PDFs hold multimedia like video and audio and are much safer than the average document file type. It is a professional document that is great for sharing because it’s hard for the recipient to edit it.
How to convert the PSD to PDF
There are three different ways to convert a PSD to a PDF. The first method is for anyone who has access to the Adobe Photoshop software. First, open your Photoshop program. Under ‘file’, select ‘save as’. Use the dropdown menu ‘format’ to change the type to PDF. Click ‘save’. This will give you a PDF in the most direct way.
The next two steps are for users who don’t have access to Photoshop. The first way is by using a browser-based converter. This method is great for users with a fast internet connection and only a few files to convert. It only requires an upload and download of a relatively small file, so this process is perfect for anyone worried about hard drive space. I recommend Zamzar for its quick speeds and simple interface.
Finally, if you want a system that operates right from your desktop, there are some installable programs available. These are ideal for anyone with a lot of hard drive space and limited to no internet access. These programs let users convert numerous files at once. I like Coolutils’ version due to its easy-to-use system.
Why convert a PSD to PDF?
The PSD and PDF are quite different file types, one being more of a graphics file and the other leaning toward a document file. Why would you need to convert the PSD to PDF? For one, the PSD is designed to be edited extensively. Its main purpose is to open into Photoshop and undergo a lot of different edits by multiple users.
The PDF, on the other hand, is typically in its final form and ready to be shared. Therefore, if you have a PSD that requires no more editing, you might convert it to a PDF document in order to make sure it doesn’t get altered further. This is especially true when sharing the file with another user or uploading it to a website. The PDF format prevents the recipient from changing your file.
Ultimately, the PDF is a much more professional document. It’s capable of acting as a contract, resume or other business file type. For all of the unique benefits of the PSD, it just can’t handle some of the things PDF can. When this is the case, make sure you know how to make a conversion."

January 21, 2020|
The PSD is a complex image file with a lot of interesting aspects that make it popular among certain groups. Unfortunately, sometimes this type of popularity is a double-edged sword, as it’s not the most accessible file type. When this is the case, you might consider converting it from PSD to PNG. Here’s a guide to help.
What is a PSD?
The PSD image file stands for Photoshop Document, due to the fact it is the standard file extension format for Adobe Photoshop files. A PSD is unique because it holds many different elements within it, including often multiple images. A PSD is typically used for things like editing graphics.
What is a PNG?
The PNG image file is a simple, common graphic format that is a raster image. Raster images build a picture through assignment of details to each particular section. A PNG is lossless, meaning when it compresses, it retains its resolution. Therefore, a PNG could go from big to small and still have the exact same quality image.
How to convert a PSD to a PNG
There are plenty of different ways to make this conversion and we’ll cover all of them. The first way is for users who have access to the Adobe Photoshop program. Open Photoshop and load the PSD file you wish to convert. From there, select ‘File’ and choose ‘Save as’. There will appear a window that lets you choose ‘PNG’ from the different options. Choose where you want the file to be saved onto your computer and click ‘Ok’. Your PSD will now be in PNG form.
If you don’t have access to Photoshop, there are two different ways to make the conversion. The first involves a browser-based system. This option is great for users who have speedy internet access and only a few files to convert. It’s also ideal for anyone with limited hard drive space. All it requires is finding a converter that works for you then uploading and downloading files. I recommend Zamzar’s converter due to its simplicity and fast speeds.
Finally, the third option is designed for users who have a lot of hard drive space but limited or no internet access. This is the installable converter which you use without internet access. It’s ideal for users who want to convert a lot of files all at once. I recommend Reaconverter for this task because of its easy interface.
Why should you convert?
The PNG is a lossless compression file, as stated earlier. Therefore, any PSD file converted to a PNG will keep its high resolution throughout different types of processes, including resizes. PSD files a lot of times have things like drawings, graphs and other image types that make them good candidates to work as a PNG.
Another reason this conversion makes sense is because the PSD is less accessible than the PNG. For example, if you send a PSD file to a client or vice-versa, there may be an issue if the receiving party doesn’t have access to Photoshop. PNG, on the other hand, is much easier to open using different programs.
The PSD is sometimes too unique in that it is limited from the average user who doesn’t have tools such as Photoshop. If you need to share a PSD file but want it in an accessible format, make sure you have a good understanding of how to convert."

October 24, 2019|
The PSD is an amazing file type for editing graphics using a vast variety of tools. Even though a PSD is shareable, it has limitations in this area. This is where a TIFF is superior. Here’s a breakdown of how to convert a PSD to a TIFF.
What is a PSD?
The PSD image file is a Photoshop document, since it is the file format of Adobe Photoshop software. A PSD isn’t specifically a singular graphic – it’s instead filled with different elements of an image. It also contains multiple images sometimes.
The PSD is best known for its extensive editing potential. It is structured for users to change its contents in a lot of different ways using advanced tools. The PSD doesn’t require any outside image-editing software because the Photoshop program is tied to the PSD and offers everything one needs to alter images.
What is a TIFF?
The TIFF image file is a Tagged Image File Format. It’s a secure image type designed for users with potentially sensitive or private images. The TIFF is a raster image, meaning it is made up using different pixels. The TIFF stores extraordinary amounts of metadata within each file.
The TIFF is one of the most unique image file types because it’s designed to be an extremely safe and secure file in a lot of different ways. Each TIFF image is transparent, ensuring no hidden viruses are attached to it. This also saves time as it gives users valuable information about the image before it’s even opened.
How to convert PSD to TIFF
There are a few different ways to convert a PSD to TIFF. The first way is manually through the Adobe Photoshop software. Here’s how:
- Open the PSD file you wish to convert using Photoshop
- Under ‘file’ choose ‘save as’
- In the format menu selection, choose TIFF
You now have a TIFF version of your original PSD file. The other method of conversion involves outside software.
To convert using third party software, first decide whether you would like to use a browser-based service or install a program to your desktop. A browser-based option is better when you don’t have a lot of hard drive space. It’s also ideal for when you only want to convert a couple of files. I recommend Zamzar to convert using this method. It’s a fast system with a simple interface. Downloading and installing a conversion software is better for people with limited internet access or a lot of files to convert all at once. For this method, I recommend PSD Viewer. It’s an easy-to-use program with fast conversion.
Why convert?
The PSD is great for professional documents that need to be securely shared with a specific group of users. However, there are times it is incompatible. It unfortunately doesn’t fit most formats when uploading it. Furthermore, it’s not a versatile image file. This is apparent when constructing a webpage. For these reasons, converting makes a lot of sense.
So when should you convert it to a TIFF? It makes sense to switch off a PSD when you need a more shareable file – one that a majority of recipients can access. The TIFF is also better at size management, as it’s capable of shrinking in size easily. Finally, though lesser-used, the metadata stored inside a TIFF file is unique and can solve a lot of problems depending on the type of work being done with the image."

November 5, 2019|
If you’re a skilled user of Adobe Illustrator, you’ll seek out opportunities to use numerous different image extensions inside the popular editing program. TIFF, for example, has a lot of dynamic qualities that don’t always prove themselves necessary. When this is the case, it’s important to know how to convert it to AI. Here’s a quick guide on how to do it.
What is a TIFF?
The TIFF image file is a tagged image file format. It’s one of the most secure image formats available. In fact, it’s so specific to security that it’s rarely used – only in certain situations that require safe graphics.
The TIFF contains an advanced level of metadata within each file, which gives users the chance to find out information about the image without even opening it. This furthers the security, as they can avoid viruses this way. Every TIFF file is extremely transparent and so is the data within it.
What is an AI file?
The AI image file is the main format extension for the popular Adobe program Illustrator. The AI uses a rare graphic type, the vector. Vector graphics are created by a forming of different points indicating different types of image elements. These images are resizable and maintain resolution while being morphed.
The AI is especially popular for companies creating brand graphics. This includes things such as logos or pictures inside newsletters. Finally, the AI allows users to generate text placements on images. This makes it stand out among standard image formats.
How to convert
There’s a few different ways to convert a TIFF to an AI. The first way is manually through the Adobe Illustrator program. In order to do this, you’ll need Illustrator installed on your system. Inside Illustrator, open the TIFF file you wish to convert. You’ll do this using ‘place’ which is located under the ‘file’ menu. Your TIFF image is now a part of the Illustrator file. You can then save the Illustrator project onto your computer.
If the above option isn’t available, consider a third party converter. There are two types to choose from: browser-based and system-based. The browser-based converter is great for users who don’t want to take up a lot of hard drive space and only need a couple files converted. Convertio has a simple system and converts very quickly.
If you need to convert a large number of TIFF files at once, it’s logical to install a converter onto your system. This holds especially true for users with limited internet access. Unlike a browser-based system, these programs allow you to convert files in bulk. I recommend ReaConverter, a fast and efficient program.
Why convert?
The TIFF Is one of the most secure image file types with a lot of safety features that aren’t always necessary for certain users. When the extensive metadata and security of the TIFF are a waste for you, it’s time to think about using a different file format. If you want to be able to drastically edit your image, an AI is the perfect choice.
An AI is easy to resize and change for all types of different projects. If you’re creating a company logo or newsletter, the AI provides everything you need. Consider this conversion especially if you have an idea for a company project that requires an image to be changed in size often.
The TIFF has so many dynamic features, it’s sometimes too complicated or unnecessarily complex for users. When this is the case for you, make sure to understand some alternative options. A conversion to AI might things a lot easier on you."
222,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-tiff-to-cr2/,"How to convert a TIFF image file to a CR2 image file
May 19, 2020|
It’s tempting to consider the possibilities that would present themselves if you converted a TIFF file to a higher resolution image. Since the TIFF is already a quality graphic, this has probably been attempted quite a bit. The CR2 is one image type that would meet the criteria of a format with higher quality than a TIFF.
So, is it possible to convert the TIFF to CR2? This guide breaks everything down for you.
What is a TIFF image file?
The TIFF image file (Tagged Image File Format) is a high resolution image that provides users with extensive security features. TIFFs are raster images, meaning they are made up of different digital dots. They use metadata to give different details about each file. The TIFF is relatively unpopular, but it’s easy to open for all Windows and Mac users.
What is a CR2 image file?
The CR2 image file gives photographers a chance to move all their pictures from Canon cameras onto a computer without losing any resolution at all. The CR2 (Canon Raw 2, meaning second edition) portrays the entirety of an image taken on a camera by a photographer. Because of the immense resolution, CR2 files are quite large. This makes them difficult so share, among other things.
Can you Convert the TIFF to CR2?
Because the CR2 is a raw format, it is the initial image file in any conversion process. It is never the end file in a conversion (meaning you wouldn’t convert from an image type into a CR2). Therefore, it’s not actually possible to convert the TIFF to CR2. However, this isn’t a big issue to worry about. There are a lot of things to consider, which we will go over.
First, let’s examine the concept of converting from the TIFF to CR2. As we know, the CR2 is specifically a raw image file from a camera. Its entire purpose is providing a high resolution file for all photographs moved from a camera to a computer. Whether or not we need a different file type from the TIFF is essentially irrelevant, since the CR2 isn’t a valid receptacle. Instead, we’ll need to find some type of alternative.
Are there any alternatives?
First of all, the reverse conversion of these file types is possible. That is, if you have a CR2 file that you would rather have in TIFF form, you can use a browser-based converter. All this requires is an internet connection and enough hard drive space to download an image file. I recommend using Zamzar to make this specific conversion because of how fast and easy-to-use it is.
However, you’re likely looking for a way to convert the TIFF into a different image format. Converting to CR2 might have been appealing due to its high resolution, so let’s find an extension that offers a high quality image as well. The PNG is a lossless compression file type, meaning it retains its quality through resizing. Luckily, the TIFF is compatible to convert into it.
As disappointing as it may seem that the TIFF doesn’t convert into the CR2, know that it wouldn’t really be a logical switch to make anyway. Instead, look for different ways to use your TIFF, including converting to a different extension if all else fails. Good luck!"
223,https://www.canto.com/blog/convert-tiff-to-eps/,"A crucial guide explaining how to convert TIFF to EPS
May 13, 2020|
If you’ve used TIFF or EPS image files extensively, you understand the unique features each contain. Similarly, these unique benefits do come with some limitations. When this affects your project, it might be time for a change. Here’s how to convert the TIFF to EPS.
What is a TIFF image file?
The TIFF image file is a unique raster image file type capable of storing extensive metadata within each file. TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is an extremely secure format, making it ideal for users who need to store professional photos digitally. The TIFF is fairly accessible, as both Windows and Mac have standard TIFF viewers.
What is an EPS image file?
The EPS image file has immense image preview and descriptive properties, which is highly convenient for most users. The EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) is a customizable image format that holds both text and graphics. Many companies purchase pictures digitally in the EPS format because of how easy it is to resize them.
How to convert the TIFF to EPS
Due to the unique dynamic of both of these two file types, this conversion requires an automated service. Luckily, this process is quite convenient and offers a few different options for optimization. The first method is done through a browser using one of the many browser-based conversion systems. This option is best for when users need to only convert a limited number of files and might have some hard drive space restrictions. When you use a browser-based system, I recommend Convertio due to its fast speeds and simplistic interface.
The other option is a bulk converter, which gives users the chance to convert many files at once. This is typically best served for those who need large quantities of image files converted. It’s also ideal for anyone who has limited internet access as well as an abundance of hard drive space. For a bulk converter, I recommend ReaConverter due to its history of success and basic features.
What’s the purpose of this conversion?
There are many different reasons one might need to convert from TIFF to EPS. Since both file types are fairly unique, it wouldn’t be necessary to convert one to the other to please a larger user-base. However, it is possible that one of the two is preferred by a lot of users you come into contact with. If that’s the case, switching from one to the other, in this instance from TIFF to EPS, would be a lot more convenient.
Comparing the features of these two formats, it becomes clear that they have a lot of similarities. Some places where they differ, however, are in the customizability features. The EPS, as noted above, is much more capable when it comes to different resizing efforts and editing projects. Because of this, there will likely be times when using the TIFF doesn’t make as much sense, and the EPS would be the way to go.
Whatever the reason, it’s clear that users won’t use a single file type forever. Keep this in mind and prepare ahead of time to succeed."

May 15, 2020|
The TIFF is one of the most unique image formats, capable of retaining high quality and safely holding metadata in each file. When you need to switch it up to a different format, the INDD makes a lot of sense. Here’s a guide explaining how to convert from the TIFF to INDD.
What is a TIFF image file?
The TIFF image file (Tagged Image File Format) is a raster image capable of storing metadata in every file. It’s most notably used to store locational data for photographers. The TIFF is quite secure, making it ideal for anyone with sensitive images. Though the TIFF isn’t extremely popular, it’s quite accessible, as both Windows and Mac have default programs that open it.
What is an INDD file?
The InDesign file extension is a file format designed for use within the popular Adobe InDesign program. The INDD handles many professional elements such as extensive layouts and page data. Users typically need the INDD to manage their printed layouts such as newspapers and flyers. It is a file type capable of containing text as well as graphics.
How to convert the TIFF to INDD
Unlike many image file conversions, going from TIFF to INDD is a lot more complicated. Firstly, there’s no third party software available that automatically converts the TIFF to INDD. There’s also not many common programs which open a TIFF and allow the user to save it into the TIFF format manually. However, this doesn’t mean the conversion is impossible. It just takes some creativity.
To make this conversion, begin by launching Adobe InDesign. Then, using the ‘File’ menu, select ‘Place’. This will give you the option of putting your TIFF image into the InDesign project, which you can then save. Once the project is saved, you’ll have the original image in the INDD format.
What’s the purpose behind this conversion?
For people who like working with the TIFF, it likely has to do with the immense quality within each image, which allows for extensive editing. It stands to reason that those who like the benefits TIFF offers would receive similar features if it were in the INDD format. This is one of many scenarios in which a conversion would make sense.
Another reason users might have for converting TIFF to INDD is for the convenience of format. The TIFF, even though sharing with the TIF, is still relatively unpopular and underused. The INDD, on the other hand, is widely-used. For you, this may be irrelevant. However, for people you work with and collaborate with, Adobe may be the only way they manage image editing. In that case, converting from TIFF to INDD would be beneficial.
When working with the TIFF, there may come a time when the INDD would be more efficient. If this happens, be sure to know how to make a conversion."

December 10, 2019|
The TIFF is rare and very unique but this sometimes works against it. Sometimes it is necessary to convert it to a smaller file type, such as JPG. Here’s a guide to help you through the process when this comes up.
What is a TIFF?
The TIFF image file is a Tagged Image File Format that is highly secure, especially in comparison to other image types. It’s a raster image file that stores metadata inside each file. It’s one of the safest types of image files because of its transparent data. It ultimately allows users to find out pertinent information about it before opening the file.
What is a JPG?
The JPG image file is the Joint Photographic Experts Group digital file type. It is interchangeable with the JPEG image file. It’s a lossy compression file type, which means it loses resolution as it shrinks in size. Finally, it’s very easy to download it and share it due to its small size.
How to convert
There are a few different ways to convert, starting with manual conversion using an editing tool. In order to do this, start by opening Adobe Photoshop. In the ‘File’ menu, open the TIFF file you wish to convert. From there, select ‘Save As’ then select ‘JPG’ as the intended file type. Once you save, it will be in the JPG form.
There are some alternative conversion options that require using third-party programs. The first method that accomplishes this is a browser-based system. This allows users to access a converter in their web browser without downloading any software programs. This choice is best served to users who have fast and abundant internet access, since it requires downloading and uploading. It’s also perfect for anyone who has limited hard drive space. Finally, it makes sense to use a browser-based system if you only need to convert a small number of files. I recommend Zamzar, a fast, simple-to-use browser-based system.
The other method is a system that installs onto your computer directly and converts right from your own machine. This option is superior for users who have limited internet access, as it’s not required to use the internet to convert. Furthermore, it’s great for anyone who has large amounts of hard drive space. Lastly, this method is ideal for anyone who needs numerous files to convert, since it can convert them all at once.
Why convert?
The TIFF is such a rare file type, it has a lot of issues for the majority of users. One of the main issues it has is its excessive file size. Most image files are relatively small and manageable. Because of this large size, anyone attempting to construct a website or blog using TIFF files will be completely frustrated. This is where switching to a smaller file size like the JPG comes in handy.
Another reason to convert is the lack of editing and accessibility of the TIFF. These rare files are simply way too hard to find a common program to open them. They also just don’t agree with a lot of editing software systems. If you need an editable image file, converting the TIFF to JPG is ideal.
Depending on what you’re doing – building a website, sharing some image files, etc. – there’s a good chance the TIFF is failing you. Make sure you understand how to convert it when this comes up."

February 11, 2020|
The TIFF file is great for a lot of reasons but there’s certainly times when it doesn’t best serve your needs. Is the NEF a reasonable alternative and is a conversion to NEF possible? Let’s take a look, starting with a breakdown of the TIFF and NEF files.
What is a TIFF?
The tagged image file format (TIFF) is a raster image that stores metadata on files. It is a highly secure image extension that gives users who have personal and sensitive a better choice for storage. Due to the transparency of the TIFF image file, they are one of the most secure image files available. In fact, with the TIFF users can verify whether a file is correct or misleading before opening it.
What is a NEF?
The NEF image file is a digital file format used to represent a raw image of any photograph snapped using a Nikon camera. NEF stands for Nikon Electronic Format. It essentially upholds all the original quality of any photograph taken with a Nikon camera and then uploaded to a computer.
Is it possible to convert a TIFF to NEF?
The NEF is merely the first step of a larger process, essentially. It either stays a raw, NEF file or it is changed into something more serviceable. Because of this, it’s not possible to convert the TIFF into the NEF. The idea of a TIFF file turning into a raw image representation of a picture taken using a Nikon camera sounds elaborate and unnecessary anyway. Therefore, you don’t really want or need to make this conversion.
The TIFF is already a superior choice of formats when compared to the NEF, at least in terms of functionality. Typically, users convert a file from one to the next when they need to make extensive edits or share it. The TIFF is already more accessible and ready to do these functions. If you still want to convert your TIFF into a different image format, there are some alternatives.
What are some alternative solutions?
The TIFF is fairly accessible, making it easy to convert into different files. There are a few different methods to consider, one is a manual conversion, the other is automated. If you’d like to convert manually, first note your operating system. A manual conversion usually depends on the types of apps on your specific OS. If, for example, you’re a Windows user, you can use Paint to convert. It’s fairly simple as well. Open Paint, import your TIFF file and save it as the format of your choice.
If you have a Mac, the process is just as simple as with Windows but requires a different app of course. In this case, use Preview and export the TIFF file as a different format. Typically, you’ll want to convert to a more popular file type, such as JPEG or PNG. This is because these formats are more widely accepted and are easier for all users to access.
The NEF is a desirable format for a lot of users but it’s not something you can just force upon other file types. Even though this is the case, there’s plenty of other ways to make your image files work for you. Find the right conversion to boost your efficiency with image files."

March 9, 2020|
Is it possible to convert the TIFF file to the ORF? Though a lot of image files convert into and save as each other, it’s not always possible (or ideal). This guide will break everything down for you and offer some alternative suggestions as well.
What is the TIFF image file?
The TIFF image file is a raster image that offers immense security features. TIFF stands for Tagged Image File Format. It is a format that stores metadata inside each file. Though it’s not the most accessible file format available, it does open without third-party software tools in both Windows and Mac operating systems.
What is an ORF image file?
The ORF image file is the standard format for which all photographs snapped using an Olympus camera are stored. ORF stands for Olympus Raw Image File. It is an extremely large file, due to the fact that it contains a high resolution, raw representation of each photograph. Essentially, the ORF replicates all photographs exactly without any quality loss. It’s easy to open an ORF file because of the Olympus Viewer, a flagship Olympus software program.
Is it possible to convert the TIFF to an ORF?
If you’ve decided to convert your TIFF files into the ORF, it’s likely because of the benefits the ORF offers – high quality images that best show photograph details. This is understandable, however, the TIFF unfortunately doesn’t convert into the ORF. The ORF exists solely as a way for Olympus camera users to get their pictures from their camera onto a computer. The ORF can then be converted into other image file types, but that’s the extent of its full functionality.
Usually, there’s a way to save images as a completely different format, essentially performing a manual conversion. However, that’s not the case with the ORF. It’s just too unique for certain purposes. Furthermore, automated converters don’t offer any methods to make a TIFF to ORF conversion. If this is disappointing, don’t worry, there are some other image types you can convert to that you’ll be more than satisfied with.
What are some alternative options?
Chances are you wanted to convert the TIFF to the ORF in order to have an image file that retained a lot of file quality and high resolution. Even though it’s impossible to make that conversion, there are some different image types that will provide some similar features. If you’re looking for a conversion that will result in a high image resolution, consider the PNG. It’s a file capable of keeping image quality, as it is a lossless compression format.
If the size and accessibility of the file is more important to you, consider converting your TIFF into something like the JPEG. The JPEG is a relatively small, manageable file type that will allow you to share it quickly with clients and other team members. Remember that the JPEG is a compressed file, meaning the image will lose some of its resolution.
Don’t be discouraged by the fact the TIFF doesn’t convert to the ORF. The reality is, there are superior options for the features and benefits you need. Make sure you have some alternatives decided upon for future cases as well."

October 11, 2019|
The PNG and TIFF are both similar in that they can be shrunk without sacrificing image quality. However, they’re definitely not interchangeable. Learn the advantages you can gain from converting a TIFF to a PNG.
What is a PNG?
The PNG image file is a Portable Network Graphic file type. It is a raster image, which constructs graphics piece-by-piece. The PNG uses lossless compression, allowing large files to be shrunk into smaller sizes without losing resolution. Also, when reverted to its original size the resolution remains.
What is a TIFF?
The TIFF image file is a Tagged Image File Format that retains excellent quality when undergoing change. The TIFF can never have links or any unseen data included inside them, making it ideal for security reasons. They’re ideal for storing valuable things like records.
How to convert TIFF to PNG
Fortunately, no third-party software is required to convert a TIFF to PNG. However, there are available browser-based systems in case you want a separate option. I’ve used both OnlineConverter and Zamzar with good results.
Using Windows
- Open the TIFF file using the Microsoft Paint app
- Select ‘file’ then ‘save as’
- From the ‘save as type’ dropdown menu, select ‘PNG’
- Save the file to your selected destination
Using Mac
- Locate the TIFF file you wish to convert
- Using Preview, click ‘file’ then choose ‘export’
- Choose PNG from the list
- Save to the location of your choice
Why convert?
The Tiff and PNG are actually quite similar image file types in that they both retain a high resolution during compression. However, there are some differences that make conversion necessary in some instances. For example, if a user has a TIFF file they wish to send to multiple people, chances are they’ll want it in the PNG format. This is due to the fact the PNG is more accessible for a wider range of users and systems.
Convenience and security are the two main factors to consider when deciding whether or not to convert. Remember, TIFF is a secure file incapable of holding a hidden virus within. For this reason, it’s used by companies with sensitive information. The PNG is less secured but also more convenient. Therefore, consider converting if you don’t need any extra security with your file.
Measure the important details and considerations when deciding whether to convert TIFF to PNG. When making an impression sharing, sending or uploading files, the file type can make all the difference."

November 6, 2019|
Knowing how to copy a URL link opens up the ability to share it. However, sharing it in different places and on different formats requires numerous techniques. Fortunately, we listed them for you in an easy-to-follow fashion. Here’s all you need to know.
How do I copy a URL link?
Copying a URL link is simple and quick. Here’s how to do it in 3 easy steps:
- Right-click the URL you want to copy
- Select ‘copy’ from the popup menu
- Navigate to wherever you wish to share the link, right-click then paste
How do I find the URL?
The URL is the location or address of a site. You’ll find it somewhere within your web browser. This will be location-dependent on which browser you use. For example, any page you’re viewing will have a location such as (‘http://……). This is your address bar and within it, the URL.
An easy way to share the URL
It’s not hard to share a URL but sometimes it’s complicated. For example, sharing a URL in a tweet or some other word count-restrictive format can be tricky. In those situations, it’s important to have a simple method to share a URL.
In this case, the best way to handle it is using a link-shortening tools such as Tinyurl. There are other URL services but we’ll use Tinyurl as the standard for the sake of simplicity. Navigate to Tinyurl and copy your link into the field form. Click the ‘Make tinyURL’ button. A new page will load with a shortened URL for you to use. Simple copy it to clipboard and then paste to wherever you want to share.
Two different ways to copy link URLs
Depending on how you want to copy your URL, you’ll need to know the difference between doing it on a desktop or on a mobile device. Here’s a guide for each:
1. On desktop
Navigate to the site you wish to copy the URL from and perform the right-click action explained above. Copy the URL and then paste it to wherever you’d like. Again, this depends on the browser you use. However, it’s going to be quite similar across the board whichever browser it is.
2. On mobile device
Right-clicking isn’t an option for a mobile device. In this case, you’ll want to hold down on the link to get a popup menu with the options to copy the URL. Note that this is relevant to different types of mobile devices such as notebooks, smart phones and tablets. It also coincides with different systems like Apple and Android.
How to copy a URL link in coded form
Sometimes, you’ll want to copy the HTML code of a link. This seems like a complicated step but it doesn’t have to be. Simply follow the solutions listed to obtain the URL in the coded format of your choice. Note that this varies from browser to browser.
- Navigate to the webpage of your choice
- Right-click anywhere on the screen and select either ‘inspect element’ (Firefox) or ‘view page source’ (Chrome)
- In the pop-up window, scroll to the top of the code to find the URL of the current page
- Right-click it
- In the pop-up window, hover ‘copy’ and select the type of code you wish to copy
Whichever device you use and whichever system you’re sharing to, make sure you copy the URL/link you want the right way. It will make all the difference."
